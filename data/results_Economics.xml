    <title>The Link Between Standardization and Economic Growth: A Bibliometric
  Analysis</title>
    <summary>  We analyze the link between standardization and economic growth by
systematically reviewing leading economics journals, leading economic growth
researchers' articles, and economic growth-related books. We make the following
observations: 1) No article has analyzed the link between standardization and
economic growth in top5 economics journals between 1996 and 2018. 2) A
representative sample of the leading researchers of economic growth has
allocated little attention to the link between standardization and economic
growth. 3) Typically, economic growth textbooks do not contain "standards" or
"standardization" in their word indexes. These findings suggest that the
economic growth theory has neglected the role of standardization.

    <title>Why Economic Theories and Policies Fail? Unnoticed Variables and
  Overlooked Economics</title>
    <summary>  Accuracy of economic theories and efficiency of economic policy strictly
depend on the choice of the economic variables and processes mostly liable for
description of economic reality. That states the general problem of assessment
of any possible economic variables and processes chargeable for economic
evolution. We show that economic variables and processes described by current
economic theories constitute only a negligible fraction of factors responsible
for economic dynamics. We consider numerous unnoted economic variables and
overlooked economic processes those determine the states and predictions of the
real economics. We regard collective economic variables, collective
transactions and expectations, mean risks of economic variables and
transactions, collective velocities and flows of economic variables,
transactions and expectations as overlooked factors of economic evolution. We
introduce market-based probability of the asset price and consider unnoticed
influence of market stochasticity on randomness of macroeconomic variables. We
introduce economic domain composed by continuous numeric risk grades and
outline that the bounds of the economic domain result in unnoticed inherent
cyclical motion of collective variables, transactions and expectations those
are responsible for observed business cycles. Our treatment of unnoticed and
overlooked factors of theoretical economics and policy decisions preserves a
wide field of studies for many decades for academic researchers, economic
authorities and high-level politicians.

    <title>Business Cycles as Collective Risk Fluctuations</title>
    <summary>  We suggest use continuous numerical risk grades [0,1] of R for a single risk
or the unit cube in Rn for n risks as the economic domain. We consider risk
ratings of economic agents as their coordinates in the economic domain.
Economic activity of agents, economic or other factors change agents risk
ratings and that cause motion of agents in the economic domain. Aggregations of
variables and transactions of individual agents in small volume of economic
domain establish the continuous economic media approximation that describes
collective variables, transactions and their flows in the economic domain as
functions of risk coordinates. Any economic variable A(t,x) defines mean risk
XA(t) as risk weighted by economic variable A(t,x). Collective flows of
economic variables in bounded economic domain fluctuate from secure to risky
area and back. These fluctuations of flows cause time oscillations of
macroeconomic variables A(t) and their mean risks XA(t) in economic domain and
are the origin of any business and credit cycles. We derive equations that
describe evolution of collective variables, transactions and their flows in the
economic domain. As illustration we present simple self-consistent equations of
supply-demand cycles that describe fluctuations of supply, demand and their
mean risks.

    <title>Econophysics of Macroeconomics: "Action-at-a-Distance" and Waves</title>
    <summary>  We present macroeconomic model that describes evolution of macroeconomic
variables and macroeconomic waves on economic space. Risk ratings of economic
agents play role of their coordinates on economic space. Aggregation of
economic variables like Assets and Investment, Credits and Loans of economic
agents at point x define corresponding macroeconomic variables as functions of
time t and coordinates x on economic space. Evolution of macroeconomic
variables is determined by economic and financial transactions between economic
agents. Such transactions can occur between economic agents with any
coordinates x and y and that reflect non-local "action-at-a-distance" character
of internal macroeconomic interactions. For instance, Buy-Sell transactions
between points x and y on economic space define dynamics of Assets at point x
and Investment at point y. Aggregates of transactions between economic agents
at point x and y on economic space define economic fields as functions of two
coordinates. To describe dynamics of economic fields on economic space we
derive hydrodynamic-like equations. For simple models of interactions between
economic fields we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form and
obtain wave equations for their perturbations. Economic field waves propagate
on economic space and their amplitudes can grow up as exponent in time and may
disturb economic stability. Diversities of macroeconomic and financial waves on
economic space in simple models uncover importance of wave processes for
macroeconomic modeling and forecasting.

    <title>Econophysics Macroeconomic Model</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents macroeconomic model that is based on parallels between
macroeconomic multi-agent systems and multi-particle systems. We use risk
ratings of economic agents as their coordinates on economic space. Aggregates
of economic or financial variables like Investment, Assets, Demand, Credits and
etc. of economic agents near point x define corresponding macroeconomic
variables as functions of time t and coordinates x on economic space. Parallels
between multi-agent and multi-particle systems on economic space allow describe
transition from economic kinetic-like to economic hydrodynamic-like
approximation and derive macroeconomic hydrodynamic-like equations on economic
space. Economic or financial transactions between economic agents determine
evolution of macroeconomic variables This paper describes local macroeconomic
approximation that takes into account transactions between economic agents with
coordinates near same point x on economic space only and describes interaction
between macroeconomic variables by linear differential operators. For simple
model of interaction between macroeconomic variables as Demand on Investment
and Interest Rate we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form. For
perturbations of these macroeconomic variables we derive macroeconomic wave
equations. Macroeconomic waves on economic space can propagate with exponential
growth of amplitude and cause irregular time fluctuations of macroeconomic
variables or induce economic crises.

  Model and Application</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a simple model to measure the relative economic growth of
economic systems. The model considers S-Shaped patterns of economic growth
that, represented with a linear model, measure how an economic system grows in
comparison with another one. In particular, this model introduces an approach
which indicates if the economic system has a process of economic growth,
development or under development. The application of the model is provided for
regions and macro regions of the Italian economic system.

    <title>Econophysics of Business Cycles: Aggregate Economic Fluctuations, Mean
  Risks and Mean Square Risks</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents hydrodynamic-like model of business cycles aggregate
fluctuations of economic and financial variables. We model macroeconomics as
ensemble of economic agents on economic space and agent's risk ratings play
role of their coordinates. Sum of economic variables of agents with coordinate
x define macroeconomic variables as functions of time and coordinates x. We
describe evolution and interactions between macro variables on economic space
by hydrodynamic-like equations. Integral of macro variables over economic space
defines aggregate economic or financial variables as functions of time t only.
Hydrodynamic-like equations define fluctuations of aggregate variables. Motion
of agents from low risk to high risk area and back define the origin for
repeated fluctuations of aggregate variables. Economic or financial variables
on economic space may define statistical moments like mean risk, mean square
risk and higher. Fluctuations of statistical moments describe phases of
financial and economic cycles. As example we present a simple model relations
between Assets and Revenue-on-Assets and derive hydrodynamic-like equations
that describe evolution and interaction between these variables.
Hydrodynamic-like equations permit derive systems of ordinary differential
equations that describe fluctuations of aggregate Assets, Assets mean risks and
Assets mean square risks. Our approach allows describe business cycle aggregate
fluctuations induced by interactions between any number of economic or
financial variables.

    <title>Impact of Public and Private Investments on Economic Growth of
  Developing Countries</title>
    <summary>  This paper aims to study the impact of public and private investments on the
economic growth of developing countries. The study uses the panel data of 39
developing countries covering the periods 1990-2019. The study was based on the
neoclassical growth models or exogenous growth models state in which land,
labor, capital accumulation, etc., and technology proved substantial for
economic growth. The paper finds that public investment has a strong positive
impact on economic growth than private investment. Gross capital formation,
labor growth, and government final consumption expenditure were found
significant in explaining the economic growth. Overall, both public and private
investments are substantial for the economic growth and development of
developing countries.

    <title>Impact of digital economic activity on regional economic growth: A Case
  study from northern Minas Gerais between 2009 To 2018</title>
    <summary>  At present, the economic measurement of the national statistical offices has
not defined or captured the benefits of the digital economy activity due to the
low quality or inexistence of methodologies. Currently, there is a relevant
debate on the capacity of the digital economy activity to generate
productivity, economic growth, and well-being through innovation and knowledge.
For this reason, this research identified and studied specialized knowledge,
human settlement, and digital economic activity as the factors that influence
regional economic growth. As a result, the impact generated by a new business
operating models based on information technology was measured. Furthermore,
this research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to
identify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic
development (PRDE) that surround economically flourishing regions. In addition,
it showed that municipalities with high degrees of economic growth were
impacted by digital economic activity and specialized knowledge. This finding
is consistent with economic growth theories that point to technological
evolution as the main factor of modern economic growth. Consequently, this
study contributed beneficial results to the local government to develop
strategies framed in solving industrial cooperation of economically flourishing
regions with their neighbors, facing the problem of agglomeration of resources
and capital reflected in human settlement promote an imbalance in economic
growth and social development.

    <title>The Economic Costs of Containing a Pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused one of the most serious social
and economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza
pandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as
well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in
a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local
governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate
suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between
economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public
interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major
problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts
certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such
economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,
there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,
which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul
Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or
otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future
generations.

    <title>Economic Reality, Economic Media and Individuals' Expectations</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates the relationship between economic media sentiment and
individuals' expetations and perceptions about economic conditions. We test if
economic media sentiment Granger-causes individuals' expectations and opinions
concerning economic conditions, controlling for macroeconomic variables. We
develop a measure of economic media sentiment using a supervised machine
learning method on a data set of Swedish economic media during the period
1993-2017. We classify the sentiment of 179,846 media items, stemming from
1,071 unique media outlets, and use the number of news items with positive and
negative sentiment to construct a time series index of economic media
sentiment. Our results show that this index Granger-causes individuals'
perception of macroeconomic conditions. This indicates that the way the
economic media selects and frames macroeconomic news matters for individuals'
aggregate perception of macroeconomic reality.

    <title>Computing Economic Chaos</title>
    <summary>  Existence theory in economics is usually in real domains such as the findings
of chaotic trajectories in models of economic growth, tatonnement, or
overlapping generations models. Computational examples, however, sometimes
converge rapidly to cyclic orbits when in theory they should be nonperiodic
almost surely. We explain this anomaly as the result of digital approximation
and conclude that both theoretical and numerical behavior can still illuminate
essential features of the real data.

    <title>'Ergodicity Economics' is Pseudoscience</title>
    <summary>  In a series of papers, Ole Peters and his collaborators claim that the
'conceptual basis of mainstream economic theory' is 'flawed' and that the
approach they call 'ergodicity economics' gives 'reason to hope for a future
economic science that is more parsimonious, conceptually clearer and less
subjective' (Peters, 2019). This paper argues that 'ergodicity economics' is
pseudoscience because it has not produced falsifiable implications and should
be taken with skepticism.

    <title>The role of complex analysis in modeling economic growth</title>
    <summary>  Development and growth are complex and tumultuous processes. Modern economic
growth theories identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the
relative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional
variables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions.
The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate
measures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and
structural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their
capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in
explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ
economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex
network techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more
traditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth
theories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement
with other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in
fostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be
either complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely
overshadow them.

    <title>A global economic policy uncertainty index from principal component
  analysis</title>
    <summary>  This paper constructs a global economic policy uncertainty index through the
principal component analysis of the economic policy uncertainty indices for
twenty primary economies around the world. We find that the PCA-based global
economic policy uncertainty index is a good proxy for the economic policy
uncertainty on a global scale, which is quite consistent with the GDP-weighted
global economic policy uncertainty index. The PCA-based economic policy
uncertainty index is found to be positively related with the volatility and
correlation of the global financial market, which indicates that the stocks are
more volatile and correlated when the global economic policy uncertainty is
higher. The PCA-based global economic policy uncertainty index performs
slightly better because the relationship between the PCA-based uncertainty and
market volatility and correlation is more significant.

    <title>The Relationship between Consumption and Economic Growth of Chinese
  Urban and Rural Residents since Reform and Opening-up -- An Empirical
  Analysis Based on Econometrics Models</title>
    <summary>  Since Reform and Opening-up 40 years ago, China has made remarkable
achievements in economic fields. And consumption activities, including
household consumption, have played an important role in it. Consumer activity
is the end of economic activity, because the ultimate aim of other economic
activities is to meet consumer demand; consumer activity is the starting point
of economic activity, because consumption can drive economic and social
development. This paper selects the economic data of more than 40 years since
Reform and Opening-up, and establishes the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model
and Vector Error Correction (VEC) model, analyzing the influence of consumption
level and total consumption of urban and rural residents on economic growth.
The conclusion is that the increase of urban consumption and rural consumption
can lead to the increase of GDP, and in the long run, urban consumption can
promote economic growth more than rural consumption. According to this
conclusion, we analyze the reasons and puts forward some policy suggestions.

    <title>Eco - No(?) - Physics - comments and reflexions -</title>
    <summary>  How can econophysics contribute to economics? Since the relation between
basic principles of physics and economics is not established, there is no
reason why physical theories should be of any value for economic theory. While
economic theories leave the physicists largely without orientation in this
field, econo-physicists should orient themselves at concrete problems from
economic practice rather than from economic academics. Thereby physicists
should respect the lead of economists. This then also puts physics closer to
econometrics. Then the natural strength of physics in dealing with empirical
data as the fundamental basis for its research could be valuable for both,
theory as well as for applications in economics.

    <summary>  We consider a number of Artificial Chemistry models for economic activity and
what consequences they have for the formation of economic inequality. We are
particularly interested in what tax measures are effective in dampening
economic inequality. By starting from well-known kinetic exchange models, we
examine different scenarios for reducing the tendency of economic activity
models to form unequal wealth distribution in equilibrium.

    <title>Infinite Growth: A Curse or a Blessing?</title>
    <summary>  The article discusses the controversy over infinite growth. It analyzes the
two dominant perspectives on economic growth and finds them based on a limited
and subjective view of reality. An examination of the principal aspects of
economic growth (economic activity, value, and value creation) helps to
understand what fuels economic growth. The article also discusses the
correlations between production, consumption, as well as resources and
population dynamics. The article finds that infinite and exponential economic
growth is essential for the survival of our civilization.

    <title>Long-term Effects of Temperature Variations on Economic Growth: A
  Machine Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  This study investigates the long-term effects of temperature variations on
economic growth using a data-driven approach. Leveraging machine learning
techniques, we analyze global land surface temperature data from Berkeley Earth
and economic indicators, including GDP and population data, from the World
Bank. Our analysis reveals a significant relationship between average
temperature and GDP growth, suggesting that climate variations can
substantially impact economic performance. This research underscores the
importance of incorporating climate factors into economic planning and
policymaking, and it demonstrates the utility of machine learning in uncovering
complex relationships in climate-economy studies.

    <title>Managing Demographic Transitions: A Comprehensive Analysis of China's
  Path to Economic Sustainability</title>
    <summary>  This article presents an analysis of China's economic evolution amidst
demographic changes from 1990 to 2050, offering valuable insights for academia
and policymakers. It uniquely intertwines various economic theories with
empirical data, examining the impact of an aging population, urbanization, and
family dynamics on labor, demand, and productivity. The study's novelty lies in
its integration of Classical, Neoclassical, and Endogenous Growth theories,
alongside models like Barro and Sala-i-Martin, to contextualize China's
economic trajectory. It provides a forward-looking perspective, utilizing
econometric methods to predict future trends, and suggests practical policy
implications. This comprehensive approach sheds light on managing demographic
transitions in a global context, making it a significant contribution to the
field of demographic economics.

    <title>Analyzing the Impact of Financial Inclusion on Economic Growth in
  Bangladesh</title>
    <summary>  Financial inclusion is touted one of the principal drivers for economic
growth for an economy. The study aims to explore the impact of financial
inclusion on economic growth in Bangladesh. In my study, I used the number of
loan accounts as the proxy for financial inclusion. Using time series data from
spans from 2004-2021, the study revealed that there exists a long-run
relationship between GDP, financial inclusion, and other macroeconomic
variables in Bangladesh. The study also found that financial inclusion had a
positive impact on economic growth of Bangladesh during the study period.
Therefore, the policymakers and the central bank of Bangladesh as the apex
authority of financial system should promote financial inclusion activities to
achieve sustainable economic growth.

    <title>Potterian Economics</title>
    <summary>  Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience offer systematic evidence that
fictional works exert a surprisingly strong influence on readers and have the
power to shape their opinions and worldviews. Building on these findings, we
study what we term Potterian economics, the economic ideas, insights, and
structure, found in Harry Potter books, to assess how the books might affect
economic literacy. A conservative estimate suggests that more than 7.3 percent
of the world population has read the Harry Potter books, and millions more have
seen their movie adaptations. These extraordinary figures underscore the
importance of the messages the books convey. We explore the Potterian economic
model and compare it to professional economic models to assess the consistency
of the Potterian economic principles with the existing economic models. We find
that some of the principles of Potterian economics are consistent with
economists models. Many other principles, however, are distorted and contain
numerous inaccuracies, contradicting professional economists views and
insights. We conclude that Potterian economics can teach us about the formation
and dissemination of folk economics, the intuitive notions of naive individuals
who see market transactions as a zero-sum game, who care about distribution but
fail to understand incentives and efficiency, and who think of prices as
allocating wealth but not resources or their efficient use.

    <title>Geobiodynamics and Roegenian Economic Systems</title>
    <summary>  This mathematical essay brings together ideas from Economics, Geobiodynamics
and Thermodynamics. Its purpose is to obtain real models of complex
evolutionary systems. More specifically, the essay defines Roegenian Economy
and links Geobiodynamics and Roegenian Economy. In this context, we discuss the
isomorphism between the concepts and techniques of Thermodynamics and
Economics. Then we describe a Roegenian economic system like a Carnot group.
After we analyse the phase equilibrium for two heterogeneous economic systems.
The European Union Economics appears like Cartesian product of Roegenian
economic systems and its Balance is analysed in details. A Section at the end
describes the "economic black holes" as small parts of a a global economic
system in which national income is so great that it causes others poor
enrichment. These ideas can be used to improve our knowledge and understanding
of the nature of development and evolution of thermodynamic-economic systems.

    <title>Inequality, mobility and the financial accumulation process: A
  computational economic analysis</title>
    <summary>  Our computational economic analysis investigates the relationship between
inequality, mobility and the financial accumulation process. Extending the
baseline model by Levy et al., we characterise the economic process through
stylised return structures generating alternative evolutions of income and
wealth through time. First, we explore the limited heuristic contribution of
one and two factors models comprising one single stock (capital wealth) and one
single flow factor (labour) as pure drivers of income and wealth generation and
allocation over time. Second, we introduce heuristic modes of taxation in line
with the baseline approach. Our computational economic analysis corroborates
that the financial accumulation process featuring compound returns plays a
significant role as source of inequality, while institutional arrangements
including taxation play a significant role in framing and shaping the aggregate
economic process that evolves over socioeconomic space and time.

    <title>Entrepreneurship, Institutions, and Economic Growth: Does the Level of
  Development Matter?</title>
    <summary>  Entrepreneurship is often touted for its ability to generate economic growth.
Through the creative-destructive process, entrepreneurs are often able to
innovate and outperform incumbent organizations, all of which is supposed to
lead to higher employment and economic growth. Although some empirical evidence
supports this logic, it has also been the subject of recent criticisms.
Specifically, entrepreneurship does not lead to growth in developing countries;
it only does in more developed countries with higher income levels. Using
Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data for a panel of 83 countries from 2002 to
2014, we examine the contribution of entrepreneurship towards economic growth.
Our evidence validates earlier studies findings but also exposes previously
undiscovered findings. That is, we find that entrepreneurship encourages
economic growth but not in developing countries. In addition, our evidence
finds that the institutional environment of the country, as measured by GEM
Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions, only contributes to economic growth in
more developed countries but not in developing countries. These findings have
important policy implications. Namely, our evidence contradicts policy
proposals that suggest entrepreneurship and the adoption of pro-market
institutions that support it to encourage economic growth in developing
countries. Our evidence suggests these policy proposals will be unlikely to
generate the economic growth desired.

    <title>Economic thermodynamics</title>
    <summary>  A thermodynamic approach to the description of economic systems and processes
is developed. It is shown that there is a deep analogy between the parameters
of thermodynamic and economic systems (markets); so each thermodynamic
parameter can be associated with a certain economic parameter or indicator. The
economic meaning of such primordially thermodynamic concepts as internal energy
and temperature has been established. It is shown that many economic laws,
which in economic theory are a generalization of the results of observations,
or are based on the analysis of the psychology of the behavior of market
actors, within the framework of economic thermodynamics can be obtained as the
natural and formal results of the theory. In particular, we show that economic
thermodynamics allows a natural description of such a phenomenon as inflation.
The thermodynamic conditions of market equilibrium stability are derived and
analyzed, as well as the Le Chatelier's principle as applied to economic
systems.

    <title>Inferring Economic Condition Uncertainty from Electricity Big Data</title>
    <summary>  Inferring the uncertainty in economic conditions is significant for both
decision makers as well as market players. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to measure the economic uncertainties by using the Hidden Markov Model
(HMM). We construct a dimensionless index, Economic Condition Uncertainty (ECU)
index, which ranges from zero to one and is comparable among sectors, regions
and periods. We used the daily electricity consumption data of more than 18,000
firms in Shanghai from 2018 to 2020 to construct the ECU indexes. Results show
that all ECU indexes, whether at sectoral or regional level, successfully
captured the negative impacts of COVID-19 on Shanghai's economic conditions.
Besides, the ECU indexes also presented the heterogeneities in different
districts as well as in different sectors. This reflects the facts that changes
in the uncertainty of economic conditions are mainly related to regional
economic structures and targeted regulatory policies faced by sectors. The ECU
index can also be readily extended to measure the uncertainty of economic
conditions in various realms, which has great potentials in the future.

    <title>The Newtonian Mechanics of Demand</title>
    <summary>  Economic engineering is a new field wherein economic systems are modelled in
the same manner as traditional mechanical and electrical engineering systems.
In this paper, we use Newton's theory of motion as the basis for the theory of
demand; thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for economic engineering.
We follow Newton's original development, as set forth in the Principia, to
determine economic analogs to his three laws of motion. The pivotal result is
an operational definition for an economic force, i.e. a want or a desire, in
terms of a price adjustment. With this, we model the price effects of scarcity
and trade friction in analogy with the models for the spring and damping force.
In turn, we define economic benefits and surplus as analogous to the
definitions of mechanical work and energy. These are then used to interpret the
various types of economic equilibrium considered by economists from a
mechanical perspective. The effectiveness of the analogy is illustrated by
applying it to modelling the price and inventory dynamics of various economic
agents -- including consumers, dealers, holders, spot and futures traders --
using linear-time invariant systems theory.

    <title>Dynamic Keller-Segel Model of Population Density and Economic Factors: A
  Simulation Study over a Century</title>
    <summary>  This study presents a computational simulation exploring the complex
interactions between population density and economic factors over a 100-year
period. Inspired by the Keller-Segel model, traditionally applied in biological
contexts, my model adapts this framework to analyze urban and economic
dynamics. The simulation employs two coupled partial differential equations to
represent the evolution of population density and money concentration in a
hypothetical region. Population density is initially uniform, while money
concentration begins with a random distribution. The model integrates diffusion
processes for both population and money, coupled with a chemotactic response of
the population towards areas of higher economic activity. Over the course of
the simulation, we observe the emergence of distinct spatial patterns:
population clusters forming around economic hubs and the development of wealth
concentration in certain areas. These patterns highlight the mutual
reinforcement between population density and economic factors. The study
provides insights into the dynamics of urban growth, economic disparities, and
resource distribution, offering a simplified yet powerful lens through which to
view complex socio-economic systems. My findings have implications for urban
planning and policy-making, especially in understanding the long-term evolution
of cities and economic centers.

    <title>Grassroots Innovation Actors: Their Role and Positioning in Economic
  Ecosystems -- A Comparative Study Through Complex Network Analysis</title>
    <summary>  This study offers an examination of grassroots innovation actors and their
integration within larger economic ecosystems. Through a comparative analysis
in Oaxaca, Mexico; La Plata, Argentina; and Araucania, Chile, this research
sheds light on the vital role that grassroots innovation plays in broader
economic ecosystems. Using Complex Network Analysis and the TE-SER model, the
study unveils how these actors interact, collaborate, and influence major
economic ecosystems in the context of complex social challenges. The findings
highlight that actors from the grassroots innovation ecosystem make up a
significant portion of the larger innovation-driven entrepreneurial economic
ecosystem, accounting for between 20% and 30% in all three cases and are
strategically positioned within the ecosystem's structural network.
Additionally, this study emphasizes the potential for greater integration of
grassroots innovation actors to leverage resources and foster socio-economic
development. The research concludes by advocating for further studies in
similar socio-economic contexts to enhance our understanding of integration
dynamics and mutual benefits between grassroots innovation ecosystems and other
larger economic systems.

    <title>Empirical Equilibria in Agent-based Economic systems with Learning
  agents</title>
    <summary>  We present an agent-based simulator for economic systems with heterogeneous
households, firms, central bank, and government agents. These agents interact
to define production, consumption, and monetary flow. Each agent type has
distinct objectives, such as households seeking utility from consumption and
the central bank targeting inflation and production. We define this multi-agent
economic system using an OpenAI Gym-style environment, enabling agents to
optimize their objectives through reinforcement learning. Standard multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) schemes, like independent learning, enable agents
to learn concurrently but do not address whether the resulting strategies are
at equilibrium. This study integrates the Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO)
algorithm, which has shown superior performance over independent MARL in games
with homogeneous agents, with economic agent-based modeling. We use PSRO to
develop agent policies approximating Nash equilibria of the empirical economic
game, thereby linking to economic equilibria. Our results demonstrate that PSRO
strategies achieve lower regret values than independent MARL strategies in our
economic system with four agent types. This work aims to bridge artificial
intelligence, economics, and empirical game theory towards future research.

    <title>Econophysics Beyond General Equilibrium: the Business Cycle Model</title>
    <summary>  Current business cycle theory is an application of the general equilibrium
theory. This paper presents the business cycle model without using general
equilibrium framework. We treat agents risk assessments as their coordinates x
on economic space and establish distribution of all economic agents by their
risk coordinates. We suggest aggregation of agents and their variables by
scales large to compare with risk scales of single agents and small to compare
with economic domain on economic space. Such model is alike to transition from
kinetic description of multi-particle system to hydrodynamic approximation.
Aggregates of agents extensive variables with risk coordinate x determine macro
variables as functions of x alike to hydrodynamic variables. Economic and
financial transactions between agents define evolution of their variables.
Aggregation of transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y
determine macro transactions as functions of x and y and define evolution of
macro variables at points x and y. We describe evolution and interactions
between macro transactions by hydrodynamic-like system of economic equations.
We show that business cycles are described as consequence of the system of
economic equations on macro transactions. As example we describe Credit
transactions CL(tax,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to
Borrowers at point y and Loan-Repayment transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe
repayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x. We use
hydrodynamic-like economic equations and derive from them the system of
ordinary differential equations that describe business cycle fluctuations of
macro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics. The
nature of business cycle fluctuations is explained as oscillations of "mean
risk" of economic variables on bounded economic domain of economic space.

    <title>The interconnectedness of the economic content in the speeches of the US
  Presidents</title>
    <summary>  The speeches stated by influential politicians can have a decisive impact on
the future of a country. In particular, the economic content of such speeches
affects the economy of countries and their financial markets. For this reason,
we examine a novel dataset containing the economic content of 951 speeches
stated by 45 US Presidents from George Washington (April 1789) to Donald Trump
(February 2017). In doing so, we use an economic glossary carried out by means
of text mining techniques. The goal of our study is to examine the structure of
significant interconnections within a network obtained from the economic
content of presidential speeches. In such a network, nodes are represented by
talks and links by values of cosine similarity, the latter computed using the
occurrences of the economic terms in the speeches. The resulting network
displays a peculiar structure made up of a core (i.e. a set of highly central
and densely connected nodes) and a periphery (i.e. a set of non-central and
sparsely connected nodes). The presence of different economic dictionaries
employed by the Presidents characterize the core-periphery structure. The
Presidents' talks belonging to the network's core share the usage of generic
(non-technical) economic locutions like "interest" or "trade". While the use of
more technical and less frequent terms characterizes the periphery (e.g.
"yield" ). Furthermore, the speeches close in time share a common economic
dictionary. These results together with the economics glossary usages during
the US periods of boom and crisis provide unique insights on the economic
content relationships among Presidents' speeches.

    <title>Narratives in economics</title>
    <summary>  There is growing awareness within the economics profession of the important
role narratives play in the economy. Even though empirical approaches that try
to quantify economic narratives are getting increasingly popular, there is no
theory or even a universally accepted definition of economic narratives
underlying this research. First, we review and categorize the economic
literature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that
are at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active
drivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative
economics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating
five important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be
economically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social
context and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a
collective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of
narratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to
the popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the
complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language
processing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go
beyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative
economics.

    <title>Large Effects of Small Cues: Priming Selfish Economic Decisions</title>
    <summary>  Many experimental studies report that economics students tend to act more
selfishly than students of other disciplines, a finding that received
widespread public and professional attention. Two main explanations that the
existing literature offers for the differences found in the behavior between
economists and noneconomists are the selection effect, and the indoctrination
effect. We offer an alternative, novel explanation. We argue that these
differences can be explained by differences in the interpretation of the
context. We test this hypothesis by conducting two social dilemma experiments
in the US and Israel with participants from both economics and non-economics
majors. In the experiments, participants face a tradeoff between profit
maximization, that is the market norm and workers welfare, that is the social
norm. We use priming to manipulate the cues that the participants receive
before they make their decision. We find that when participants receive cues
signaling that the decision has an economic context, both economics and
non-economics students tend to maximize profits. When the participants receive
cues emphasizing social norms, on the other hand, both economics and
non-economics students are less likely to maximize profits. We conclude that
some of the differences found between the decisions of economics and
non-economics students can be explained by contextual cues.

    <title>How to predict and avert economic crisis</title>
    <summary>  Our study shows that many firms would accumulate at zero output level
(namely, Bankruptcy status) if a perfectly competitive market reaches full
employment (namely, those people who should obtain employment have obtained
employment). As a result, appearance of economic crisis is determined by two
points; that is, (a). Stock market approaches perfect competition; (b). Society
reaches full employment. The empirical research of these two points would lead
to early warning of economic crisis. Moreover, it is a surprise that the state
of economic crisis would be a feasible equilibrium within the framework of the
Arrow-Debreu model. That means that we can not understand the origin of
economic crisis within the framework of modern economics, for example, the
general equilibrium theory.

    <title>Mathematical Analysis of the Historical Economic Growth</title>
    <summary>  Data describing historical economic growth are analysed. Included in the
analysis is the world and regional economic growth. The analysis demonstrates
that historical economic growth had a natural tendency to follow hyperbolic
distributions. Parameters describing hyperbolic distributions have been
determined. A search for takeoffs from stagnation to growth produced negative
results. This analysis throws a new light on the interpretation of the
mechanism of the historical economic growth and suggests new lines of research.

    <title>Hybrid threats as an exogenous economic shock</title>
    <summary>  The aim of this study is to contribute to the theory of exogenous economic
shocks and their equivalents in an attempt to explain business cycle
fluctuations, which still do not have a clear explanation. To this end the
author has developed an econometric model based on a regression analysis.
Another objective is to tackle the issue of hybrid threats, which have not yet
been subjected to a cross-disciplinary research. These were reviewed in terms
of their economic characteristics in order to complement research in the fields
of defence and security.

    <title>Engineering Economics in the Conflux Network</title>
    <summary>  Proof-of-work blockchains need to be carefully designed so as to create the
proper incentives for miners to faithfully maintain the network in a
sustainable way. This paper describes how the economic engineering of the
Conflux Network, a high throughput proof-of-work blockchain, leads to sound
economic incentives that support desirable and sustainable mining behavior. In
detail, this paper parameterizes the level of income, and thus network
security, that Conflux can generate, and it describes how this depends on user
behavior and "policy variables'' such as block and interest inflation. It also
discusses how the underlying economic engineering design makes the Conflux
Network resilient against double spending and selfish mining attacks.

    <title>Thermodynamics of markets</title>
    <summary>  We consider the thermodynamic approach to the description of economic systems
and processes. The first and second laws of thermodynamics as applied to
economic systems are derived and analyzed. It is shown that there is a deep
analogy between the parameters of thermodynamic and economic systems (markets);
in particular, each thermodynamic parameter can be associated with a certain
economic parameter or indicator. The economic meaning of such primordially
thermodynamic concepts as pressure, volume, internal energy, heat, etc. has
been established. The thermostatistics of the market is considered. It is shown
that, as in conventional thermostatistics, many market parameters, such as
price of goods, quantity of goods, etc., as well as their fluctuations can be
calculated formally using the partition function of an economic system.

    <title>Inequality in Turkey: Looking Beyond Growth</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates the relationships between economic growth, investment
in human capital and income equality in Turkey. The conclusion drawn based on
the data from the OECD and the World Bank suggests that economic growth can
improve income equality depending on the expenditures undertaken by the
government. As opposed to the standard view that economic growth and income
inequality are positively related, the findings of this paper suggest that
other factors such as education and healthcare spending are also driving
factors of income inequality in Turkey. The proven positive impact of
investment in education and health care on income equality could aid
policymakers who aim to achieve fairer income equality and economic growth, in
investment decisions.

    <title>Decision making in Economics -- a behavioral approach</title>
    <summary>  We review economic research regarding the decision making processes of
individuals in economics, with a particular focus on papers which tried
analyzing factors that affect decision making with the evolution of the history
of economic thought. The factors that are discussed here are psychological,
emotional, cognitive systems, and social norms. Apart from analyzing these
factors, it deals with the reasons behind the limitations of rational
decision-making theory in individual decision making and the need for a
behavioral theory of decision making. In this regard, it has also reviewed the
role of situated learning in the decision-making process.

    <title>Labour by Design: Contributions of David Card, Joshua Angrist, and Guido
  Imbens</title>
    <summary>  The 2021 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred
Nobel was awarded to David Card "for his empirical contributions to labour
economics" and to Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens "for their methodological
contributions to the analysis of causal relationships." We survey these
contributions of the three laureates, and discuss how their empirical and
methodological insights transformed the modern practice of applied
microeconomics. By emphasizing research design and formalizing the causal
content of different econometric procedures, the laureates shed new light on
key questions in labour economics and advanced a robust toolkit for empirical
analyses across many fields.

    <title>Pandemics Depress the Economy, Public Health Interventions Do Not:
  Evidence from the 1918 Flu</title>
    <summary>  We study the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on mortality
and economic activity across U.S. cities during the 1918 Flu Pandemic. The
combination of fast and stringent NPIs reduced peak mortality by 50% and
cumulative excess mortality by 24% to 34%. However, while the pandemic itself
was associated with short-run economic disruptions, we find that these
disruptions were similar across cities with strict and lenient NPIs. NPIs also
did not worsen medium-run economic outcomes. Our findings indicate that NPIs
can reduce disease transmission without further depressing economic activity, a
finding also reflected in discussions in contemporary newspapers.

    <title>Timely pandemic countermeasures reduce both health damage and economic
  loss: Generality of the exact solution</title>
    <summary>  Balancing pandemic control and economics is challenging, as the numerical
analysis assuming specific economic conditions complicates obtaining
predictable general findings. In this study, we analytically demonstrate how
adopting timely moderate measures helps reconcile medical effectiveness and
economic impact, and explain it as a consequence of the general finding of
``economic irreversibility" by comparing it with thermodynamics. A general
inequality provides the guiding principles on how such measures should be
implemented. The methodology leading to the exact solution is a novel
theoretical contribution to the econophysics literature.

    <title>Knowledge Management in Socio-Economic Development of Municipal Units:
  Basic Concepts</title>
    <summary>  The article discusses the basic concepts of strategic planning in the Russian
Federation, highlights the legal, financial and resource features that act as
restrictions in decision making in the field of socio-economic development of
municipalities. The analysis concluded that to design an adequate model of
socio-economic development of municipalities is a very difficult task,
particularly when the traditional approaches are applied. To solve the task, we
proposed to use the semantic modeling as well as cognitive maps which are able
to point out the set of dependencies that arise between factors having a direct
impact on socio-economic development.

    <title>Cryptoeconomics and Tokenomics as Economics: A Survey with Opinions</title>
    <summary>  This paper surveys products and studies on cryptoeconomics and tokenomics
from an economic perspective, as these terms are still (i) ill-defined and (ii)
disconnected from economic disciplines. We first suggest that they can be novel
when integrated; we then conduct a literature review and case study following
consensus-building for decentralization and token value for autonomy.
Integration requires simultaneous consideration of strategic behavior,
spamming, Sybil attacks, free-riding, marginal cost, marginal utility and
stabilizers. This survey is the first systematization of knowledge on
cryptoeconomics and tokenomics, aiming to bridge the contexts of economics and
blockchain.

    <title>Complexity, economic science and possible economic benefits of climate
  change mitigation policy</title>
    <summary>  Conventional economic analysis of stringent climate change mitigation policy
generally concludes various levels of economic slowdown as a result of
substantial spending on low carbon technology. Equilibrium economics however
could not explain or predict the current economic crisis, which is of financial
nature. Meanwhile the economic impacts of climate policy find their source
through investments for the diffusion of environmental innovations, in parts a
financial problem. Here, we expose how results of economic analysis of climate
change mitigation policy depend entirely on assumptions and theory concerning
the finance of the diffusion of innovations, and that in many cases, results
are simply re-iterations of model assumptions. We show that, while equilibrium
economics always predict economic slowdown, methods using non-equilibrium
approaches suggest the opposite could occur. We show that the solution to
understanding the economic impacts of reducing greenhouse gas emissions lies
with research on the dynamics of the financial sector interacting with
innovation and technology developments, economic history providing powerful
insights through important analogies with previous historical waves of
innovation.

    <title>Analisis de la incidencia de la inversion extranjera directa y la
  inversion nacional, en el crecimiento economico de Chile</title>
    <summary>  The research aims to assess the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) and
domestic investment on Chile's economic growth. By elucidating the relationship
between FDI and domestic investment, the study contributes valuable insights
for economic policy formulation and future investments. The findings hold
significance in shaping Chile's international perception as an investment
destination, potentially influencing its standing in the global economic
landscape. Demonstrating that FDI is a significant driver of economic growth
could enhance confidence among foreign investors. The project's importance lies
in contributing to economic knowledge and guiding strategic decisions for
sustainable economic growth in Chile. Understanding the interplay of FDI and
domestic investment allows for a balanced approach, promoting stable economic
development and mitigating issues like excessive reliance on foreign
investment. The study highlights the theory of internationalization as a
conceptual framework for understanding the motives and strategies of
multinational companies investing abroad. Leveraging data from sources like the
Central Bank of Chile, the research analyzes variables such as Chile's economic
growth (GDP), FDI, and domestic investment. The hypothesis posits a significant
long-term causal relationship between FDI, National Investment (NI), and
Chile's Economic Growth (GDP). Statistical analysis using the Eviews 6 software
tool confirms that attracting foreign investments and promoting internal
investment are imperative for sustainable economic growth in Chile.

models familiar from physics to economic observables, remarkable regularities
in economic data may suggest parts of social order that can usefully be
incorporated into, and in turn can broaden, the conceptual structure of
physics.

    <title>Quantifying China's Regional Economic Complexity</title>
    <summary>  China has experienced an outstanding economic expansion during the past
decades, however, literature on non-monetary metrics that reveal the status of
China's regional economic development are still lacking. In this paper, we fill
this gap by quantifying the economic complexity of China's provinces through
analyzing 25 years' firm data. First, we estimate the regional economic
complexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces'
ECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic
development and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of
ECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare
different measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with
monetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the
non-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have
stronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate
regressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other
socioeconomic factors. Our work moves forward a step towards better
understanding China's regional economic development and non-monetary
macroeconomic indicators.

    <title>Phase Diagram for Roegenian Economics</title>
    <summary>  We recall the similarities between the concepts and techniques of
Thermodynamics and Roegenian Economics. The Phase Diagram for a Roegenian
economic system highlights a triple point and a critical point, with related
explanations. These ideas can be used to improve our knowledge and
understanding of the nature of development and evolution of Roegenian economic
systems.

    <title>NISE Estimation of an Economic Model of Crime</title>
    <summary>  An economic model of crime is used to explore the consistent estimation of a
simultaneous linear equation without recourse to instrumental variables. A
maximum-likelihood procedure (NISE) is introduced, and its results are compared
to ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares. The paper is motivated
by previous research on the crime model and by the well-known practical problem
that valid instruments are frequently unavailable.

    <title>The Use of Quantile Methods in Economic History</title>
    <summary>  Quantile regression and quantile treatment effect methods are powerful
econometric tools for considering economic impacts of events or variables of
interest beyond the mean. The use of quantile methods allows for an examination
of impacts of some independent variable over the entire distribution of
continuous dependent variables. Measurement in many quantative settings in
economic history have as a key input continuous outcome variables of interest.
Among many other cases, human height and demographics, economic growth,
earnings and wages, and crop production are generally recorded as continuous
measures, and are collected and studied by economic historians. In this paper
we describe and discuss the broad utility of quantile regression for use in
research in economic history, review recent quantitive literature in the field,
and provide an illustrative example of the use of these methods based on 20,000
records of human height measured across 50-plus years in the 19th and 20th
centuries. We suggest that there is considerably more room in the literature on
economic history to convincingly and productively apply quantile regression
methods.

    <title>Theoretical Economics and the Second-Order Economic Theory. What is it?</title>
    <summary>  The economic and financial variables of economic agents determine
macroeconomic variables. Current models consider agents' variables that are
determined by the sums of values and volumes of agents' trades during some time
interval {\Delta}. We call them first-order economic variables. We describe how
the volatilities and correlations of market trade values and volumes determine
price volatility. We argue that such a link requests consideration of agents'
economic variables of the second order that are composed of sums of squares of
agents' transactions during {\Delta}. Almost any variable of the first order
should be complemented by its second-order pair. Respectively, the sums of
agents' second-order variables introduce macroeconomic variables of the second
order. The description of the first- and second-order macroeconomic variables
establishes the subject of second-order economic theory. We highlight that the
complexity of second-order economic theory essentially restricts any hopes for
precise predictions of price probability and, at best, could provide estimates
of price volatility. That limits the predictions of price probability to
Gauss's approximations only.

    <title>Economic activity and climate change</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we survey recent econometric contributions to measure the
relationship between economic activity and climate change. Due to the critical
relevance of these effects for the well-being of future generations, there is
an explosion of publications devoted to measuring this relationship and its
main channels. The relation between economic activity and climate change is
complex with the possibility of causality running in both directions. Starting
from economic activity, the channels that relate economic activity and climate
change are energy consumption and the consequent pollution. Hence, we first
describe the main econometric contributions about the interactions between
economic activity and energy consumption, moving then to describing the
contributions on the interactions between economic activity and pollution.
Finally, we look at the main results on the relationship between climate change
and economic activity. An important consequence of climate change is the
increasing occurrence of extreme weather phenomena. Therefore, we also survey
contributions on the economic effects of catastrophic climate phenomena.

    <title>Relevance of financial development and fiscal stability in dealing with
  disasters in Emerging Economies</title>
    <summary>  Previous studies show that natural disasters decelerate economic growth, and
more so in countries with lower financial development. We confirm these results
with more recent data. We are the first to show that fiscal stability reduces
the negative economic impact of natural disasters in poorer countries, and that
catastrophe bonds have the same effect in richer countries.

    <title>Exploring the Relationship Between COVID-19 Induced Economic Downturn
  and Women's Nutritional Health Disparities</title>
    <summary>  This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impact has
exacerbated nutritional health disparities among women. It sought to understand
the effects of economic challenges on women's dietary choices and access to
nutritious food across different socioeconomic groups. Using a mixed-methods
approach, the research combined quantitative data from health and economic
records with qualitative insights from interviews with diverse women. The study
analyzed trends in nutritional health and economic factors before and after the
pandemic and gathered personal accounts regarding nutrition and economic
difficulties during this period. Findings showed a clear link between the
economic downturn and deteriorating nutritional health, particularly in
low-income and marginalized groups. These women reported decreased access to
healthy foods and an increased dependence on less nutritious options due to
budget constraints, leading to a decline in dietary quality. This trend was
less evident in higher-income groups, highlighting stark disparities. The
pandemic intensified pre-existing nutritional inequalities, with the most
vulnerable groups facing greater adverse effects. However, community support
and public health measures provided some relief. In summary, the pandemic's
economic repercussions have indirectly impaired women's nutritional health,
especially among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This highlights the
necessity for tailored nutritional interventions and economic policies focused
on safeguarding women's health.

    <title>Economic Forces in Stock Returns</title>
    <summary>  When analyzing the components influencing the stock prices, it is commonly
believed that economic activities play an important role. More specifically,
asset prices are more sensitive to the systematic economic news that impose a
pervasive effect on the whole market. Moreover, the investors will not be
rewarded for bearing idiosyncratic risks as such risks are diversifiable. In
the paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an
attribution model to identify the specific systematic economic forces
influencing the market. They first defined and examined five classic factors
from previous research papers: Industrial Production, Unanticipated Inflation,
Change in Expected Inflation, Risk Premia, and The Term Structure. By adding in
new factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they
examined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The
paper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic
news, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the
significant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by
such motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general
framework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic
factors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.

    <title>Soviet Mathematics and Economic Theory in the Past Century: An
  Historical Reappraisal</title>
    <summary>  What are the effects of authoritarian regimes on scholarly research in
economics? And how might economic theory survive ideological pressures? The
article addresses these questions by focusing on the mathematization of
economics over the past century and drawing on the history of Soviet science.
Mathematics in the USSR remained internationally competitive and generated many
ideas that were taken up and played important roles in economic theory. These
same ideas, however, were disregarded or adopted only in piecemeal fashion by
Soviet economists, despite the efforts of influential scholars to change the
economic research agenda. The article draws this contrast into sharper focus by
exploring the work of Soviet mathematicians in optimization, game theory, and
probability theory that was used in Western economics. While the intellectual
exchange across the Iron Curtain did help advance the formal modeling
apparatus, economics could only thrive in an intellectually open environment
absent under the Soviet rule.

    <title>LLM economicus? Mapping the Behavioral Biases of LLMs via Utility Theory</title>
    <summary>  Humans are not homo economicus (i.e., rational economic beings). As humans,
we exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring,
framing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as
such biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs)
are trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases?
Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support
human decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of
modern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs.
Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior
against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To
demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a
variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of
current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We
also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic
behavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure
the effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases.

    <title>Economic inequality and Islamic Charity: An exploratory agent-based
  modeling approach</title>
    <summary>  Economic inequality is one of the pivotal issues for most of economic and
social policy makers across the world to insure the sustainable economic growth
and justice. In the mainstream school of economics, namely neoclassical
theories, economic issues are dealt with in a mechanistic manner. Such a
mainstream framework is majorly focused on investigating a socio-economic
system based on an axiomatic scheme where reductionism approach plays a vital
role. The major limitations of such theories include unbounded rationality of
economic agents, reducing the economic aggregates to a set of predictable
factors and lack of attention to adaptability and the evolutionary nature of
economic agents. In tackling deficiencies of conventional economic models, in
the past two decades, some new approaches have been recruited. One of those
novel approaches is the Complex adaptive systems (CAS) framework which has
shown a very promising performance in action. In contrast to mainstream school,
under this framework, the economic phenomena are studied in an organic manner
where the economic agents are supposed to be both boundedly rational and
adaptive. According to it, the economic aggregates emerge out of the ways
agents of a system decide and interact. As a powerful way of modeling CASs,
Agent-based models (ABMs) has found a growing application among academicians
and practitioners. ABMs show that how simple behavioral rules of agents and
local interactions among them at micro-scale can generate surprisingly complex
patterns at macro-scale. In this paper, ABMs have been used to show (1) how an
economic inequality emerges in a system and to explain (2) how sadaqah as an
Islamic charity rule can majorly help alleviating the inequality and how
resource allocation strategies taken by charity entities can accelerate this
alleviation.

    <title>Staring at Economic Aggregators through Information Lenses</title>
    <summary>  It is hard to exaggerate the role of economic aggregators -- functions that
summarize numerous and / or heterogeneous data -- in economic models since the
early XX$^{th}$ century. In many cases, as witnessed by the pioneering works of
Cobb and Douglas, these functions were information quantities tailored to
economic theories, i.e. they were built to fit economic phenomena. In this
paper, we look at these functions from the complementary side: information. We
use a recent toolbox built on top of a vast class of distortions coined by
Bregman, whose application field rivals metrics' in various subfields of
mathematics. This toolbox makes it possible to find the quality of an
aggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc.), from the
standpoint of the information it carries. We prove a rather striking result.
  From the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong
to the \textit{optimal} set. As common economic assumptions enter the analysis,
this large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up \textit{exactly fitting}
either CES, or Cobb-Douglas, or both. To summarize, in the relevant economic
contexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the
information standpoint. We also discuss global economic behaviors of optimal
information aggregators in general, and present a brief panorama of the links
between economic and information aggregators.

    <title>Does Infrastructure Investment Lead to Economic Growth or Economic
  Fragility? Evidence from China</title>
    <summary>  The prevalent view in the economics literature is that a high level of
infrastructure investment is a precursor to economic growth. China is
especially held up as a model to emulate. Based on the largest dataset of its
kind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates
economic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery.
Far from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure
investment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's
track record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich
democracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive
projects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in
financial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We
conclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation
of surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless
China shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the
country is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic
crisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy.
China's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other
countries but one to avoid.

    <title>Deep Neural Networks for Choice Analysis: Extracting Complete Economic
  Information for Interpretation</title>
    <summary>  While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied to choice
analysis showing high predictive power, it is unclear to what extent
researchers can interpret economic information from DNNs. This paper
demonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as
classical discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information includes
choice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns
of alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities,
marginal rates of substitution (MRS), and heterogeneous values of time (VOT).
Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn the utility function and reveal
behavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts. However, the
economic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable because of the three
challenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to
hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. To
demonstrate the strength and challenges of DNNs, we estimated the DNNs using a
stated preference survey, extracted the full list of economic information from
the DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the
economic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more
reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or
trainings, and that even simple hyperparameter searching can significantly
improve the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs.
Future studies should investigate other regularizations and DNN architectures,
better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address
DNNs' three challenges, to provide more reliable economic information from
DNN-based choice models.

    <title>The AI Economist: Optimal Economic Policy Design via Two-level Deep
  Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <summary>  AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have improved many areas, but are not yet
widely adopted in economic policy design, mechanism design, or economics at
large. At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of
counterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to
experiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that
machine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism
design framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a
two-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who
co-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel
two-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn
rational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal
taxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal
tax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist
substantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off
between equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent
tax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral
change more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the
first time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a
complement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational
learning-based approach to understanding economic policy.

    <title>A 3D index for measuring economic resilience with application to the
  modern international and global financial crises</title>
    <summary>  The study and measurement of economic resilience is ruled by high level of
complexity related to the diverse structure, functionality, spatiality, and
dynamics describing economic systems. Towards serving the demand of
integration, this paper develops a three-dimensional index, capturing
engineering, ecological, and evolutionary aspects of economic resilience that
are considered separately in the current literature. The proposed index is
computed on GDP data of worldwide countries, for the period 1960-2020,
concerning 14 crises considered as shocks, and was found well defined in a
conceptual context of its components. Its application on real-world data allows
introducing a novel classification of countries in terms of economic
resilience, and reveals geographical patterns and structural determinants of
this attribute. Impressively enough, economic resilience appears positively
related to major productivity coefficients, gravitationally driven, and
depended on agricultural specialization, with high structural heterogeneity in
the low class. Also, the analysis fills the literature gap by shaping the
worldwide map of economic resilience, revealing geographical duality and
centrifugal patterns in its geographical distribution, a relationship between
diachronically good performance in economic resilience and geographical
distance from the shocks origin, and a continent differentiation expressed by
the specialization of America in engineering resilience, Africa and Asia in
ecological and evolutionary resilience, and a relative lag of Europe and
Oceania. Finally, the analysis provides insights into the effect of the 2008 on
the globe and supports a further research hypothesis that political instability
is a main determinant of low economic resilience, addressing avenues of further
research.

    <title>Economic Systems in Metaverse: Basics, State of the Art, and Challenges</title>
    <summary>  Economic systems play pivotal roles in the metaverse. However, we have not
yet found an overview that systematically introduces economic systems for the
metaverse. Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures,
and systems related to economic systems. When investigating those
state-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in our mind: (1) what is the
framework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse, and (2) what
activities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to
disclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and
the future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic-system
framework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements
in the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital
trading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed
economic-system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary
systems, digital wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, and
cross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly
discuss three questions: a) the rationale of this topic, b) why the metaverse
needs this topic, and c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through
this overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the
metaverse needs, and the insights behind the economic activities in the
metaverse.

    <title>Processes analogous to ecological interactions and dispersal shape the
  dynamics of economic activities</title>
    <summary>  The processes of ecological interactions, dispersal and mutations shape the
dynamics of biological communities, and analogous eco-evolutionary processes
acting upon economic entities have been proposed to explain economic change.
This hypothesis is compelling because it explains economic change through
endogenous mechanisms, but it has not been quantitatively tested at the global
economy level. Here, we use an inverse modelling technique and 59 years of
economic data covering 77 countries to test whether the collective dynamics of
national economic activities can be characterised by eco-evolutionary
processes. We estimate the statistical support of dynamic community models in
which the dynamics of economic activities are coupled with positive and
negative interactions between the activities, the spatial dispersal of the
activities, and their transformations into other economic activities. We find
strong support for the models capturing positive interactions between economic
activities and spatial dispersal of the activities across countries. These
results suggest that processes akin to those occurring in ecosystems play a
significant role in the dynamics of economic systems. The strength-of-evidence
obtained for each model varies across countries and may be caused by
differences in the distance between countries, specific institutional contexts,
and historical contingencies. Overall, our study provides a new quantitative,
biologically inspired framework to study the forces shaping economic change.

    <title>Physical energy cost serves as the ''invisible hand'' governing economic
  valuation: Direct evidence from biogeochemical data and the U.S. metal market</title>
    <summary>  Energy supply is mandatory for the production of economic value.
Nevertheless, tradition dictates that an enigmatic 'invisible hand' governs
economic valuation. Physical scientists have long proposed alternative but
testable energy cost theories of economic valuation, and have shown the gross
correlation between energy consumption and economic output at the national
level through input-output energy analysis. However, due to the difficulty of
precise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive
evidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual
commodities has yet been found. Over the past century, the US metal market has
accumulated a huge body of price data, which for the first time ever provides
us the opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct energy-value
correlation. Here, by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical
elements (mainly metals) relative to the total energy consumption for refining
them from naturally occurring geochemical conditions, we found a clear
correlation between the energy cost and their market prices. The underlying
physics we proposed has compatibility with conventional economic concepts such
as the ratio between supply and demand or scarcity's role in economic
valuation. It demonstrates how energy cost serves as the 'invisible hand'
governing economic valuation. Thorough understanding of this energy connection
between the human economic and the Earth's biogeochemical metabolism is
essential for improving the overall energy efficiency and furthermore the
sustainability of the human society.

    <title>Non-Banking Sector development effect on Economic Growth. A Nighttime
  light data approach</title>
    <summary>  This paper uses nighttime light(NTL) data to measure the nexus of the
non-banking sector, particularly insurance, and economic growth in South
Africa. We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic
growth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection
and optimal risk mitigation. We also claim that Nighttime light data is a good
economic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted
regressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and
insurance sector development. We used time series South African GDP data
collected from the World Bank for the period running from 2000 to 2018, and the
nighttime lights data from the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) in
partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
From the models fitted and the reported BIC, AIC, and likelihood ratios, the
insurance sector proved to have more predictive power on economic development
in South Africa, and radiance light explained economic growth better than GDP
and GDP/Capita. We concluded that nighttime data is a good proxy for economic
growth than GDP/Capita in emerging economies like South Africa, where secondary
data needs to be more robust and sometimes inflated. The findings will guide
researchers and policymakers on what drives economic development and what
policies to put in place. It would be interesting to extend the current study
to other sectors such as micro-finances, mutual and hedge funds.

    <title>The Equilibrium Statistical Model of Economic Systems using Concepts and
  Theorems of Statistical Physics</title>
    <summary>  Economic systems are similar with physic systems for their large number of
individuals and the exist of equilibrium. In this paper, we present a model
applying the equilibrium statistical model in economic systems. Consistent with
statistical physics, we define a series of concepts, such as economic
temperature, economic pressure, economic potential, wealth and population.
Moreover, we suggest that these parameters show pretty close relationship with
the concepts in economy. This paper presents related concepts in the
equilibrium economic model and constructs significant theorems and corollaries,
which is derived from the priori possibility postulate, getting theorems
including the equilibrium theorem between open systems, the distribution
theorem of wealth and population along with related corollaries. More
importantly, we demonstrate a method constructing optimal density of states,
optimizing a macroscopic parameter depending on need to get the distribution of
density of states utilizing the variation method, which is significant for the
development of a society. In addition, we calculate a simple economic system as
an example, indicating that the system occupied mostly by the middle class
could develop stably and soundly, explaining the reason for resulting
distributions of macroscopic parameters.

    <title>Theory of pricing as relativistic kinematics</title>
    <summary>  The algebra of transactions as fundamental measurements is constructed on the
basis of the analysis of their properties and represents an expansion of the
Boolean algebra. The notion of the generalized economic measurements of the
economic quantity and quality of objects of transactions is introduced. It has
been shown that the vector space of economic states constructed on the basis of
these measurements is relativistic. The laws of kinematics of economic objects
in this space have been analyzed and the stages of constructing the dynamics
have been formulated. In particular, the principle of maximum benefit, which
represents an economic analog of the principle of least action in the classical
mechanics, and the principle of relativity as the principle of equality of all
possible consumer preferences have been formulated. The notion of economic
interval between two economic objects invariant to the selection of the vector
of consumer preferences has been introduced. Methods of experimental
verification of the principle of relativity in the space of economic states
have been proposed.

    <title>Online Social Activity Reflects Economic Status</title>
    <summary>  To characterize economic development and diagnose the economic health
condition, several popular indices such as gross domestic product (GDP),
industrial structure and income growth are widely applied. However, computing
these indices based on traditional economic census is usually costly and
resources consuming, and more importantly, following a long time delay. In this
paper, we analyzed nearly 200 million users' activities for four consecutive
years in the largest social network (Sina Microblog) in China, aiming at
exploring latent relationships between the online social activities and local
economic status. Results indicate that online social activity has a strong
correlation with local economic development and industrial structure, and more
interestingly, allows revealing the macro-economic structure instantaneously
with nearly no cost. Beyond, this work also provides a new venue to identify
risky signal in local economic structure.

    <title>Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Economic Growth in Asia</title>
    <summary>  Historical economic growth in Asia (excluding Japan) is analysed. It is shown
that Unified Growth Theory is contradicted by the data, which were used (but
not analysed) during the formulation of this theory. Unified Growth Theory does
not explain the mechanism of economic growth. It explains the mechanism of
Malthusian stagnation, which did not exist and it explains the mechanism of the
transition from stagnation to growth that did not happen. The data show that
the economic growth in Asia was never stagnant but hyperbolic. The alleged
dramatic takeoff around 1900 or around any other time did not happen. However,
the theory contains also a dangerous and strongly-misleading concept that after
a long epoch of stagnation we have now entered the epoch of sustained economic
growth, the concept creating the sense of security. The opposite is true. After
the epoch of sustained and secure economic growth we have now entered the epoch
of a fast-increasing and insecure economic growth.

    <title>Toward Development of a New Health Economic Evaluation Definition</title>
    <summary>  Economic evaluation is a dynamically advancing knowledge area of health
economics. It has been conceived to provide evidence for allocating scarce
resources to gain the best value for money. The problem of efficiency of
investments becomes even more crucial with advances in modern medicine and
public health which bring about both improved patient outcomes and higher
costs. Despite the abundance of literature on the economic evaluation concepts,
some key notions including the definition of the health economic evaluation
remain open for discussion. Academic literature offers a large number and
growing variety of economic evaluation definitions. It testifies to the fact
that existing definitions do not meet requirements of economists. The aim of
this study was to examine existing definitions and reveal their common
features.

    <title>Economic interpretation of fractional derivatives</title>
    <summary>  An economic interpretation of the Caputo derivatives of non-integer orders is
proposed. The suggested economic interpretation of the fractional derivatives
is based on a generalization of average and marginal values of economic
indicators. We formulate an economic interpretation by using the concept of the
T-indicator that allows us to describe economic processes with memory. The
standard average and marginal values of indicator are special cases of the
proposed T-indicator, when the order is equal to zero and one, respectively.
The fractional derivatives are interpreted as economic characteristics
(indicators) that are intermediate between the standard average and marginal
values of indicators.

    <title>State-of-the-Art Economic Load Dispatch of Power Systems Using Particle
  Swarm Optimization</title>
    <summary>  Metaheuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has emerged as one
of the most promising optimization techniques in solving highly constrained
non-linear and non-convex optimization problems in different areas of
electrical engineering. Economic operation of the power system is one of the
most important areas of electrical engineering where PSO has been used
efficiently in solving various issues of practical systems. In this paper, a
comprehensive survey of research works in solving various aspects of economic
load dispatch (ELD) problems of power system engineering using different types
of PSO algorithms is presented. Five important areas of ELD problems have been
identified, and the papers published in the general area of ELD using PSO have
been classified into these five sections. These five areas are (i) single
objective economic load dispatch, (ii) dynamic economic load dispatch, (iii)
economic load dispatch with non-conventional sources, (iv) multi-objective
environmental/economic dispatch, and (v) economic load dispatch of microgrids.
At the end of each category, a table is provided which describes the main
features of the papers in brief. The promising future works are given at the
conclusion of the review.

    <title>The Interdependence of Hierarchical Institutions: Federal Regulation,
  Job Creation, and the Moderating Effect of State Economic Freedom</title>
    <summary>  Regulation is commonly viewed as a hindrance to entrepreneurship, but
heterogeneity in the effects of regulation is rarely explored. We focus on
regional variation in the effects of national-level regulations by developing a
theory of hierarchical institutional interdependence. Using the political
science theory of market-preserving federalism, we argue that regional economic
freedom attenuates the negative influence of national regulation on net job
creation. Using U.S. data, we find that regulation destroys jobs on net, but
regional economic freedom moderates this effect. In regions with average
economic freedom, a one percent increase in regulation results in 14 fewer jobs
created on net. However, a standard deviation increase in economic freedom
attenuates this relationship by four fewer jobs. Interestingly, this moderation
accrues strictly to older firms; regulation usually harms young firm job
creation, and economic freedom does not attenuate this relationship.

    <title>Identifying Different Definitions of Future in the Assessment of Future
  Economic Conditions: Application of PU Learning and Text Mining</title>
    <summary>  The Economy Watcher Survey, which is a market survey published by the
Japanese government, contains \emph{assessments of current and future economic
conditions} by people from various fields. Although this survey provides
insights regarding economic policy for policymakers, a clear definition of the
word "future" in future economic conditions is not provided. Hence, the
assessments respondents provide in the survey are simply based on their
interpretations of the meaning of "future." This motivated us to reveal the
different interpretations of the future in their judgments of future economic
conditions by applying weakly supervised learning and text mining. In our
research, we separate the assessments of future economic conditions into
economic conditions of the near and distant future using learning from positive
and unlabeled data (PU learning). Because the dataset includes data from
several periods, we devised new architecture to enable neural networks to
conduct PU learning based on the idea of multi-task learning to efficiently
learn a classifier. Our empirical analysis confirmed that the proposed method
could separate the future economic conditions, and we interpreted the
classification results to obtain intuitions for policymaking.

    <title>Comprehensive Review of Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods and
  Applications in Economics</title>
    <summary>  The popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods in economics have
been exponentially increased. DRL through a wide range of capabilities from
reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning (DL) for handling sophisticated
dynamic business environments offers vast opportunities. DRL is characterized
by scalability with the potential to be applied to high-dimensional problems in
conjunction with noisy and nonlinear patterns of economic data. In this work,
we first consider a brief review of DL, RL, and deep RL methods in diverse
applications in economics providing an in-depth insight into the state of the
art. Furthermore, the architecture of DRL applied to economic applications is
investigated in order to highlight the complexity, robustness, accuracy,
performance, computational tasks, risk constraints, and profitability. The
survey results indicate that DRL can provide better performance and higher
accuracy as compared to the traditional algorithms while facing real economic
problems at the presence of risk parameters and the ever-increasing
uncertainties.

    <title>The impact of economic policy uncertainties on the volatility of
  European carbon market</title>
    <summary>  The European Union Emission Trading Scheme is a carbon emission allowance
trading system designed by Europe to achieve emission reduction targets. The
amount of carbon emission caused by production activities is closely related to
the socio-economic environment. Therefore, from the perspective of economic
policy uncertainty, this article constructs the GARCH-MIDAS-EUEPU and
GARCH-MIDAS-GEPU models for investigating the impact of European and global
economic policy uncertainty on carbon price fluctuations. The results show that
both European and global economic policy uncertainty will exacerbate the
long-term volatility of European carbon spot return, with the latter having a
stronger impact when the change is the same. Moreover, the volatility of the
European carbon spot return can be forecasted better by the predictor, global
economic policy uncertainty. This research can provide some implications for
market managers in grasping carbon market trends and helping participants
control the risk of fluctuations in carbon allowances.

    <title>The Relationship between the Economic and Financial Crises and
  Unemployment Rate in the European Union -- How Institutions Affected Their
  Linkage</title>
    <summary>  This paper aims to estimate the impact of economic and financial crises on
the unemployment rate in the European Union, taking also into consideration the
institutional specificities, since unemployment was the main channel through
which the economic and financial crisis influenced the social developments.. In
this context, I performed two institutional clusters depending on their
inclusive or extractive institutional features and, in each cases, I computed
the crisis effect on unemployment rate over the 2003-2017 period. Both models
were estimated by using Panel Estimated Generalized Least Squares method, and
are weighted by Period SUR option in order to remove, in advance the possible
inconveniences of the models. The institutions proved to be a relevant
criterion that drives the impact of economic and financial crises on the
unemployment rate, highlighting that countries with inclusive institutions are
less vulnerable to economic shocks and are more resilient than countries with
extractive institutions. The quality of institutions was also found to have a
significant effect on the response of unemployment rate to the dynamic of its
drivers.

    <title>Do economic effects of the anti-COVID-19 lockdowns in different regions
  interact through supply chains?</title>
    <summary>  To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many cities, states, and countries have
`locked down', restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such
lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study
examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact
through supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an
agent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in
Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the
interactions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by
decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We
find that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier
substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the
economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region
lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on
whether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked
through supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy
coordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.

    <title>Urbanization and Economic Complexity</title>
    <summary>  Urbanization plays a crucial role in the economic development of every
country. The mutual relationship between the urbanization of any country and
its economic productive structure is far from being understood. We analyzed the
historical evolution of product exports for all countries using the World Trade
Web (WTW) with respect to patterns of urbanization from 1995-2010. Using the
evolving framework of economic complexity, we reveal that a country's economic
development in terms of its production and export of goods, is interwoven with
the urbanization process during the early stages of its economic development
and growth. Meanwhile in urbanized countries, the reciprocal relation between
economic growth and urbanization fades away with respect to its later stages,
becoming negligible for countries highly dependent on the export of resources
where urbanization is not linked to any structural economic transformation.

    <title>Differentiation of subjects of the Russian Federation according to the
  main parameters of socio-economic development</title>
    <summary>  This article presents the results of a cluster analysis of the regions of the
Russian Federation in terms of the main parameters of socio-economic
development according to the data presented in the official data sources of the
Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat). Studied and analyzed the domestic
and foreign (Eurostat) methodology for assessing the socio-economic development
of territories. The aim of the study is to determine the main parameters of
territorial differentiation and to identify key indicators that affect the
socio-economic development of Russian regions. The authors have carried out a
classification of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation not in
terms of territorial location and geographical features, but in terms of the
specifics and key parameters of the socio-economic situation.

    <title>Techno-Economic Assessment Models for 5G</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes the characteristics a techno-economic model for 5G should
have considering both mobile network operators perspective and end users needs.
It also presents a review and classification of models in the literature based
on the characteristics of such theoretical techno-economic reference model. The
performed analysis identifies current gaps in the techno-economic modeling
literature for 5G architectures and shows it can be enhanced using agile
techno-economic models like the Universal Techno-Economic Model (UTEM) created
and developed by the author to industrialize assessment of different
technological solutions, considering all market players perspectives and
applicable to decision-making in multiple domains. This model can be used for
an effective and agile 5G techno-economic assessment, including not only
network deployment perspective but also customers and end users requirements as
well as other stakeholders to select the most adequate 5G architectural
solution considering both technical and economic feasibility. UTEM model is
currently available for all industry stakeholders under specific license of
use.

    <title>Priming prosocial behavior and expectations in response to the Covid-19
  pandemic -- Evidence from an online experiment</title>
    <summary>  This paper studies whether and how differently projected information about
the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic affects individuals' prosocial behavior and
expectations on future outcomes. We conducted an online experiment with British
participants (N=961) when the UK introduced its first lockdown and the outbreak
was on its growing stage. Participants were primed with either the
environmental or economic consequences (i.e., negative primes), or the
environmental or economic benefits (i.e., positive primes) of the pandemic, or
with neutral information. We measured priming effects on an incentivized
take-and-give dictator game and on participants' expectations about future
environmental quality and economic growth. Our results show that primes affect
participants' expectations, but not their prosociality. In particular,
participants primed with environmental consequences hold a more pessimistic
view on future environmental quality, while those primed with economic benefits
are more optimistic about future economic growth. Instead, the positive
environmental prime and the negative economic prime do not influence
expectations. Our results offer insights into how information affects behavior
and expectations during the Covid-19 pandemic.

    <title>The Levy Flight of Cities: Analyzing Social-Economical Trajectories with
  Auto-Embedding</title>
    <summary>  It has been found that human mobility exhibits random patterns following the
Levy flight, where human movement contains many short flights and some long
flights, and these flights follow a power-law distribution. In this paper, we
study the social-economical development trajectories of urban cities. We
observe that social-economical movement of cities also exhibit the Levy flight
characteristics. We collect the social and economical data such as the
population, the number of students, GDP and personal income, etc. from several
cities. Then we map these urban data into the social and economical factors
through a deep-learning embedding method Auto-Encoder. We find that the
social-economical factors of these cities can be fitted approximately as a
movement pattern of a power-law distribution. We use the Stochastic
Multiplicative Processes (SMP) to explain such movement, where in the presence
of a boundary constraint, the SMP leads to a power law distribution. It means
that the social-economical trajectories of cities also follow a Levy flight
pattern, where some years have large changes in terms of social-economical
development, and many years have little changes.

    <title>Cost-optimal Seeding Strategy During a Botanical Pandemic in
  Domesticated Fields</title>
    <summary>  Botanical pandemics cause enormous economic damage and food shortages around
the globe. However, since botanical pandemics are here to stay in the
short-medium term, domesticated field owners can strategically seed their
fields to optimize each session's economic profit. In this work, we propose a
novel epidemiological-economic mathematical model that describes the economic
profit from a field of plants during a botanical pandemic. We describe the
epidemiological dynamics using a spatio-temporal extended
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model with a non-linear output
economic model. We provide an algorithm to obtain an optimal grid-formed
seeding strategy to maximize economic profit, given field and pathogen
properties. We show that the recovery and basic infection rates have a similar
economic influence. Unintuitively, we show that a larger farm does not promise
higher economic profit. Our results demonstrate a significant benefit of using
the proposed seeding strategy and shed more light on the dynamics of the
botanical pandemic.

    <title>Firm-level supply chains to minimize unemployment and economic losses in
  rapid decarbonization scenarios</title>
    <summary>  Urgently needed carbon emissions reductions might lead to strict
command-and-control decarbonization strategies with potentially negative
economic consequences. Analysing the entire firm-level production network of a
European economy, we have explored how the worst outcomes of such approaches
can be avoided. We compared the systemic relevance of every firm in Hungary
with its annual CO2 emissions to identify optimal emission-reducing strategies
with a minimum of additional unemployment and economic losses. Setting specific
reduction targets, we studied various decarbonization scenarios and quantified
their economic consequences. We determined that for an emissions reduction of
20%, the most effective strategy leads to losses of about 2% of jobs and 2% of
economic output. In contrast, a naive scenario targeting the largest emitters
first results in 28% job losses and 33% output reduction for the same target.
This demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level production networks to
design highly effective decarbonization strategies that practically preserve
employment and economic output.

    <title>Idaho Blacks: Quiet Economic Triumph of Enduring Champions</title>
    <summary>  As the United States is witnessing elevated racial differences pertaining to
economic disparities, we have found a unique example contrary to the
traditional narrative. Idaho is the only US state where Blacks earn more than
Whites and all other races. In this paper, we examine how Idaho Blacks might
have achieved economic success and, more importantly, what factors might have
led to this achievement in reducing racial and economic disparities.
Preliminary research suggests that fewer barriers to land ownership, smaller
populations, well-knit communities, men's involvement in the family, and a
relatively less hostile environment have played a significant role. Further
research by historians can help the nation uncover the underlying factors to
see if some factors are transportable to other parts of the country.

    <title>Foreign Capital and Economic Growth: Evidence from Bangladesh</title>
    <summary>  This study aims to examine the relationship between Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI), personal remittances received, and official development assistance (ODA)
in the economic growth of Bangladesh. The study utilizes time series data on
Bangladesh from 1976 to 2021. Additionally, this research contributes to the
existing literature by introducing the Foreign Capital Depthless Index (FCDI)
and exploring its impact on Bangladesh's economic growth. The results of the
Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) suggest that the economic growth of
Bangladesh depends on FDI, remittances, and aid in the long run. However, these
variables do not exhibit a causal relationship with GDP in the short run. The
relationship between FCDI and economic growth is positive in the long run.
Nevertheless, the presence of these three variables has a more significant
impact on the economic growth of Bangladesh

    <title>ABIDES-Economist: Agent-Based Simulation of Economic Systems with
  Learning Agents</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a multi-agent simulator for economic systems comprised of
heterogeneous Households, heterogeneous Firms, Central Bank and Government
agents, that could be subjected to exogenous, stochastic shocks. The
interaction between agents defines the production and consumption of goods in
the economy alongside the flow of money. Each agent can be designed to act
according to fixed, rule-based strategies or learn their strategies using
interactions with others in the simulator. We ground our simulator by choosing
agent heterogeneity parameters based on economic literature, while designing
their action spaces in accordance with real data in the United States. Our
simulator facilitates the use of reinforcement learning strategies for the
agents via an OpenAI Gym style environment definition for the economic system.
We demonstrate the utility of our simulator by simulating and analyzing two
hypothetical (yet interesting) economic scenarios. The first scenario
investigates the impact of heterogeneous household skills on their learned
preferences to work at different firms. The second scenario examines the impact
of a positive production shock to one of two firms on its pricing strategy in
comparison to the second firm. We aspire that our platform sets a stage for
subsequent research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and
economics.

    <title>Machine learning and economic forecasting: the role of international
  trade networks</title>
    <summary>  This study examines the effects of de-globalization trends on international
trade networks and their role in improving forecasts for economic growth. Using
section-level trade data from nearly 200 countries from 2010 to 2022, we
identify significant shifts in the network topology driven by rising trade
policy uncertainty. Our analysis highlights key global players through
centrality rankings, with the United States, China, and Germany maintaining
consistent dominance. Using a horse race of supervised regressors, we find that
network topology descriptors evaluated from section-specific trade networks
substantially enhance the quality of a country's GDP growth forecast. We also
find that non-linear models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM,
outperform traditional linear models used in the economics literature. Using
SHAP values to interpret these non-linear model's predictions, we find that
about half of most important features originate from the network descriptors,
underscoring their vital role in refining forecasts. Moreover, this study
emphasizes the significance of recent economic performance, population growth,
and the primary sector's influence in shaping economic growth predictions,
offering novel insights into the intricacies of economic growth forecasting.

    <title>Sustainable regional economic development and land use: a case of Russia</title>
    <summary>  This paper analyzes sustainable regional economic development and land use
employing a case study of Russia. The economics of land management in Russia
which is shaped by both historical legacies and contemporary policies
represents an interesting conundrum. Following the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, Russia embarked on a thorny and complex path towards the economic
reforms and transformation characterized, among all, by the privatization and
decentralization of land ownership. This transition was aimed at improving
agricultural productivity and fostering sustainable regional economic
development but also led to new challenges such as uneven distribution of land
resources, unclear property rights, and underinvestment in rural
infrastructure. However, managing all of that effectively poses significant
challenges and opportunities. With the help of the comprehensive bibliographic
network analysis, this study sheds some light on the current state of
sustainable regional economic development and land use management in Russia.
Its results and outcomes might be helpful for the researchers and stakeholders
alike in devising effective strategies aimed at maximizing resources for
sustainable land use, particularly within their respective regional economies.

    <title>The Economy and Public Diplomacy: An Analysis of RT's Economic Content
  and Context on Facebook</title>
    <summary>  With globalization's rise, economic interdependence's impacts have become a
prominent factor affecting personal lives, as well as national and
international dynamics. This study examines RT's public diplomacy efforts on
its non-Russian Facebook accounts over the past five years to identify the
prominence of economic topics across language accounts. Computational analysis,
including word embeddings and statistical methods, investigates how offline
economic indicators, like currency values and oil prices, correspond to RT's
online economic content changes. The results demonstrate that RT uses message
reinforcement associated economic topics as an audience targeting strategy and
differentiates their use with changing currency and oil values.

    <title>Economic Complexity in Mono-Partite Networks</title>
    <summary>  Initially designed to predict and explain the economic trajectories of
countries, cities, and regions, economic complexity has been found applicable
in diverse contexts such as ecology and chess openings. The success of economic
complexity stems from its capacity to assess hidden capabilities within a
system indirectly. The existing algorithms for economic complexity operate only
when the underlying interaction topology conforms to a bipartite graph. A
single link disrupting the bipartite structure renders these algorithms
inapplicable, even if the weight of that link is tiny compared to others. This
paper presents a novel extension of economic complexity to encompass any graph,
overcoming the constraints of bipartite structures. Additionally, it introduces
fitness centrality and orthofitness centrality as new centrality measures in
graphs. Fitness Centrality emerges as a promising metric for assessing node
vulnerability, akin to node betweenness centrality. Furthermore, we unveil the
cost functions that drive the minimization procedures underlying the economic
complexity index and fitness centrality algorithms. This extension broadens the
scope of economic complexity analysis, enabling its application in diverse
network structures beyond bipartite graphs.

    <title>Trade Openness, Tariffs and Economic Growth: An Empirical Study from
  Countries of G-20</title>
    <summary>  International trade has been in the forefront of economic development and
growth debates. Trade openness, its definition, scope, and impacts have also
been studied numerously. Tariff has been dubbed as negative influencer of
economic growth as per conventional wisdom and most empirical studies. This
paper empirically examines relationships among trade openness as trade share to
GDP, import tariff rate and economic growth. Panel dataset of 11 G-20 member
countries were selected for the study. Results found a positively significant
correlation between trade openness and economic growth. Tariff has negatively
significant correlation with economic growth in lagged model. OLS and panel
data fixed-effects regression were employed to carry out the regression
analysis. To deal with endogeneity in trade openness variable, a 1-year lag
regression technique was conducted. Results are robust and significant. Policy
recommendation suggests country specific trade opening and tariff relaxation.

    <title>Mode of sustainable economic development</title>
    <summary>  To implement the previously formulated principles of sustainable economic
development, all non-negative solutions of the linear system of equations and
inequalities, which are satisfied by the vector of real consumption, are
completely described. It is established that the vector of real consumption
with the minimum level of excess supply is determined by the solution of some
quadratic programming problem. The necessary and sufficient conditions are
established under which the economic system, described by the "input-output"
production model, functions in the mode of sustainable development. A complete
description of the equilibrium states for which markets are partially cleared
in the economy model of production "input-output" is given, on the basis that
all solutions of system of linear equations and inequalities are completely
described. The existence of a family of taxation vectors in the "input-output"
model of production, under which the economic system is able to function in the
mode of sustainable development, is proved. Restrictions were found for the
vector of taxation in the economic system, under which the economic system is
able to function in the mode of sustainable development. The axioms of the
aggregated description of the economy is proposed.

    <title>Big data in economics</title>
    <summary>  The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around
2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information
assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need
special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form
them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology
field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental
decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,
engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,
social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide
enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic
research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure
the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,
population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic
phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will
start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources
can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast
and with reduced costs.

    <title>EconNLI: Evaluating Large Language Models on Economics Reasoning</title>
    <summary>  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for writing economic analysis
reports or providing financial advice, but their ability to understand economic
knowledge and reason about potential results of specific economic events lacks
systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we propose a new dataset, natural
language inference on economic events (EconNLI), to evaluate LLMs' knowledge
and reasoning abilities in the economic domain. We evaluate LLMs on (1) their
ability to correctly classify whether a premise event will cause a hypothesis
event and (2) their ability to generate reasonable events resulting from a
given premise. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are not sophisticated in
economic reasoning and may generate wrong or hallucinated answers. Our study
raises awareness of the limitations of using LLMs for critical decision-making
involving economic reasoning and analysis. The dataset and codes are available
at https://github.com/Irenehere/EconNLI.

    <title>Reinterpreting economic complexity in multiple dimensions</title>
    <summary>  We build on the interpretation of the Economic Complexity method as
Correspondence Analysis (CA), and propose that the Canonical form of CA (CCA),
which originated in the ecology literature, can be used to calculate
multi-dimensional economic complexity. The traditional (CA) way of calculating
economic complexity includes no "external" information such as countries'
development characteristics to facilitate interpretation of "complexity". This
has led to a wide range of fairly ad hoc interpretations of economic complexity
on the basis of ex-post correlation to a long list of other variables. By the
ex-ante inclusion of a number of country variables in the construction of the
complexity indicators, CCA enables better interpretation, also in the case of
multi-dimensional indicators. The analysis is further facilitated by another
element of the ecologists' toolbox, the so-called biplots, which are CCA-based
graph embeddings that represent a lower-dimensional product-space in which
products and countries are positioned together, in mutual correspondence to
each other. We show that in this way, CCA provides a richer account of
development in many of its aspects, especially economic growth.

    <title>An Interacting Agent Model of Economic Crisis</title>
    <summary>  Most national economies are linked by international trade. Consequently,
economic globalization forms a massive and complex economic network with strong
links, that is, interactions arising from increasing trade. Various interesting
collective motions are expected to emerge from strong economic interactions in
a global economy under trade liberalization. Among the various economic
collective motions, economic crises are our most intriguing problem. In our
previous studies, we have revealed that the Kuramoto's coupled limit-cycle
oscillator model and the Ising-like spin model on networks are invaluable tools
for characterizing the economic crises. In this study, we develop a
mathematical theory to describe an interacting agent model that derives the
Kuramoto model and the Ising-like spin model by using appropriate
approximations. Our interacting agent model suggests phase synchronization and
spin ordering during economic crises. We confirm the emergence of the phase
synchronization and spin ordering during economic crises by analyzing various
economic time series data. We also develop a network reconstruction model based
on entropy maximization that considers the sparsity of the network. Here
network reconstruction means estimating a network's adjacency matrix from a
node's local information. The interbank network is reconstructed using the
developed model, and a comparison is made of the reconstructed network with the
actual data. We successfully reproduce the interbank network and the known
stylized facts. In addition, the exogenous shock acting on an industry
community in a supply chain network and financial sector are estimated.
Estimation of exogenous shocks acting on communities of in the real economy in
the supply chain network provide evidence of the channels of distress
propagating from the financial sector to the real economy through the supply
chain network.

    <title>Spontaneous Economic Order</title>
    <summary>  This paper provides an attempt to formalize Hayek's notion of spontaneous
order within the framework of the Arrow-Debreu economy. Our study shows that if
a competitive economy is enough fair and free, then a spontaneous economic
order shall emerge in long-run competitive equilibria so that social members
together occupy an optimal distribution of income. Despite this, the
spontaneous order might degenerate in the form of economic crises whenever an
equilibrium economy approaches the extreme competition. Remarkably, such a
theoretical framework of spontaneous order provides a bridge linking Austrian
economics and Neoclassical economics, where we shall comprehend a truth:
"Freedom promotes technological progress".

    <title>When does the stock market listen to economic news? New evidence from
  copulas and news wires</title>
    <summary>  We study association between macroeconomic news and stock market returns
using the statistical theory of copulas, and a new comprehensive measure of
news based on the indexing of news wires. We find the impact of economic news
on equity returns to be nonlinear and asymmetric. In particular, controlling
for economic conditions and surprises associated with releases of economic
data, we find that the market reacts strongly and negatively to the most
unfavourable macroeconomic news, but appears to largely discount the good news.
This relationship persists throughout the different stages of the business
cycle.

    <title>Achieving Economic Operation and Secondary Frequency Regulation
  Simultaneously Through Feedback Control</title>
    <summary>  This article presents an exciting finding for the power industry: the
parameters of secondary frequency control based on integral or proportional
integral control can be tuned to achieve economic operation and frequency
regulation simultaneously. We show that if the power imbalance is represented
by frequency deviation, an iterative dual decomposition based economic dispatch
solving is equivalent to integral control. An iterative method of multipliers
based economic dispatch is equivalent to proportional integral control.
Similarly, if the controller parameters of the secondary frequency controls are
chosen based on generator cost functions, these secondary frequency controllers
achieve both economic operation and frequency regulation simultaneously.

    <title>Modélisation spatiale de la formation des agglomérations dans la
  zone algéroise</title>
    <summary>  The goal of this study is to analyze the dynamics underlying Algiers urban
area formation with reference to The New Economic Geography (NEG) theories and
more precisely to the paper of Paul Krugman (1991), "Increasing returns and
economic geography" which explains the mechanisms of economic activities
concentration through two types of forces: centripetal forces enhancing the
economic activities concentration and centrifugal forces hindering the
agglomeration process. In fact, these mechanisms are translated into a system
of nonlinear equations which is very hard to solve analytically. As a
consequence, the use of numerical methods is highly advocated. We present some
numerical simulations using real Algerian data.

    <title>IMF Lending and Economic Growth: An Empirical Analysis of Ukraine</title>
    <summary>  This study uses Vector Autoregression (VAR) Methodology as well as Vector
Error Correction (VEC) Methodology to examine the existence and direction of
causality between economic growth and IMF lending for Ukraine. The paper
examines the IMF lending data for the period of 1991-2010. Robust empirical
analysis indicates that IMF lending has a negative effect of on Ukraine's
economic growth in the short term. Policy implications of this finding are
that, despite short-run decline in economic growth, IMF lending can result in a
long-run sustainable growth for Ukraine. For this, policymakers need to ensure
that fund's money are used not only to cover budget's deficit, but also to
finance institutional reforms.

    <title>Classifications of Innovations Survey and Future Directions</title>
    <summary>  The purpose of this paper is to focus on similarity and/or heterogeneity of
taxonomies of innovation present in the economic fields to show as the economic
literature uses different names to indicate the same type of technical change
and innovation, and the same name for different types of innovation. This
ambiguity of classification makes it impossible to compare the various studies;
moreover the numerous typologies existing in the economics of innovation,
technometrics, economics of technical change, management of technology, etc.,
have hindered the development of knowledge in these fields. The research
presents also new directions on the classification of innovation that try to
overcome these problems.

    <title>Dimensional Analysis in Economics: A Study of the Neoclassical Economic
  Growth Model</title>
    <summary>  The fundamental purpose of the present research article is to introduce the
basic principles of Dimensional Analysis in the context of the neoclassical
economic theory, in order to apply such principles to the fundamental relations
that underlay most models of economic growth. In particular, basic instruments
from Dimensional Analysis are used to evaluate the analytical consistency of
the Neoclassical economic growth model. The analysis shows that an adjustment
to the model is required in such a way that the principle of dimensional
homogeneity is satisfied.

    <title>Variety, Complexity and Economic Development</title>
    <summary>  We propose a combinatorial model of economic development. An economy develops
by acquiring new capabilities allowing for the production of an ever greater
variety of products of increasingly complex products. Taking into account that
economies abandon the least complex products as they develop over time, we show
that variety first increases and then decreases in the course of economic
development. This is consistent with the empirical pattern known as 'the hump'.
Our results question the common association of variety with complexity. We
further discuss the implications of our model for future research.

    <title>Determinants of Social-economic Mobility in the Northern Region of
  Malaysia</title>
    <summary>  Colleting the data through a survey in the Northern region of Malaysia;
Kedah, Perlis, Penang and Perak, this study investigates intergenerational
social mobility in Malaysia. We measure and analyzed the factors that influence
social-economic mobility by using binary choice model (logit model). Social
mobility can be measured in several ways, by income, education, occupation or
social class. More often, economic research has focused on some measure of
income. Social mobility variable is measured using the difference between
educational achievement between a father and son. If there is a change of at
least of two educational levels between a father and son, then this study will
assign the value one which means that social mobility has occurred.

    <title>Classifying economics for the common good: Connecting sustainable
  development goals to JEL codes</title>
    <summary>  How does economics research help in solving societal challenges? This brief
note sheds additional light on this question by providing ways to connect
Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) codes and Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) of the United Nations. These simple linkages illustrate that the themes
of SDGs have corresponding JEL classification codes. As the mappings presented
here are necessarily imperfect and incomplete, there is plenty of room for
improvements. In an ideal world, there would be a JEL classification system for
SDGs, a separate JEL code for each of the 17 SDGs.

    <title>Nash SIR: An Economic-Epidemiological Model of Strategic Behavior During
  a Viral Epidemic</title>
    <summary>  This paper develops a Nash-equilibrium extension of the classic SIR model of
infectious-disease epidemiology ("Nash SIR"), endogenizing people's decisions
whether to engage in economic activity during a viral epidemic and allowing for
complementarity in social-economic activity. An equilibrium epidemic is one in
which Nash equilibrium behavior during the epidemic generates the epidemic.
There may be multiple equilibrium epidemics, in which case the epidemic
trajectory can be shaped through the coordination of expectations, in addition
to other sorts of interventions such as stay-at-home orders and accelerated
vaccine development. An algorithm is provided to compute all equilibrium
epidemics.

    <title>Examining the drivers of business cycle divergence between Euro Area and
  Romania</title>
    <summary>  This research aims to provide an explanatory analyses of the business cycles
divergence between Euro Area and Romania, respectively its drivers, since the
synchronisation of output-gaps is one of the most important topic in the
context of a potential EMU accession. According to the estimates, output-gaps
synchronisation entered on a downward path in the subperiod 2010-2017, compared
to 2002-2009. The paper demonstrates there is a negative relationship between
business cycles divergence and three factors (economic structure convergence,
wage structure convergence and economic openness), but also a positive
relationship between it and its autoregressive term, respectively the GDP per
capita convergence.

    <title>The impact of financial risks on economic growth in EU-15</title>
    <summary>  This paper examines the impact of financial risks on economic growth in the
first 15 Member States of the European Union, considering 1995-2014 period and
aims to lay down a new explanatory model of economic growth, based mainly on
the behavioral reactivity of the financial disruptions mentioned above. The
model was estimated through the panel estimated generalized least squares
method and included additional control variables in order to strengthen the
research conducted. Our goal consists in the examination of the financial risks
in the European Union and in the estimation of their impact on economic growth.

    <title>Impact of crop diversification on socio-economic life of tribal farmers:
  A case study from Eastern ghats of India</title>
    <summary>  In this study we investigated impact of crop diversification on
socio-economic life of tribal people from eastern ghats of India. We have
adopted linear regression formalism to check impact of cross diversification.
We observe a positive intercept for almost all factors. Coefficient of
correlation is calculated to examine the inter dependence of CDI and our
various individually measured dependent variables. A positive correlation is
observed in almost all factors. This study shows that a positive change
occurred in their social, economic life in the post diversification era.

    <title>ICT and Employment in India: A Sectoral Level Analysis</title>
    <summary>  How technology affects growth or employment has long been debated. With a
hiatus, the debate revived once again in the form of how Information and
Communications Technology, as a form of new technology, exerts on productivity
and employment. Information and Communications Technology perceived as General
Purpose Technology like steam engine or electricity in the past, ushered the
world into a new techno-economic paradigm, given its deep social, economic and
cultural implications. For instance, within economic implication, it is hard to
imagine an economic activity that does not it, directly or indirectly.
Eventually, Information and Communications Technology intensity, measure as the
ratio of Information and Communications Technology investment to total
investment, increased phenomenally in industries across sectors.

    <title>Token Economics in Energy Systems: Concept, Functionality and
  Applications</title>
    <summary>  Traditional centralized energy systems have the disadvantages of difficult
management and insufficient incentives. Blockchain is an emerging technology,
which can be utilized in energy systems to enhance their management and
control. Integrating token economy and blockchain technology, token economic
systems in energy possess the characteristics of strong incentives and low
cost, facilitating integrating renewable energy and demand side management, and
providing guarantees for improving energy efficiency and reducing emission.
This article describes the concept and functionality of token economics, and
then analyzes the feasibility of applying token economics in the energy
systems, and finally discuss the applications of token economics with an
example in integrated energy systems.

    <title>Critical review of models, containing cultural levels beyond the
  organizational one</title>
    <summary>  The current article traces back the scientific interest to cultural levels
across the organization at the University of National and World Economy, and
especially in the series of Economic Alternatives - an official scientific
magazine, issued by this Institution. Further, a wider and critical review of
international achievements in this field is performed, revealing diverse
analysis perspectives with respect to cultural levels. Also, a useful model of
exploring and teaching the cultural levels beyond the organization is proposed.

    <title>The unreasonable effectiveness of optimal transport in economics</title>
    <summary>  Optimal transport has become part of the standard quantitative economics
toolbox. It is the framework of choice to describe models of matching with
transfers, but beyond that, it allows to: extend quantile regression; identify
discrete choice models; provide new algorithms for computing the random
coefficient logit model; and generalize the gravity model in trade. This paper
offer a brief review of the basics of the theory, its applications to
economics, and some extensions.

    <title>Economic Recession Prediction Using Deep Neural Network</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the effectiveness of different machine learning methodologies
in predicting economic cycles. We identify the deep learning methodology of
Bi-LSTM with Autoencoder as the most accurate model to forecast the beginning
and end of economic recessions in the U.S. We adopt commonly-available macro
and market-condition features to compare the ability of different machine
learning models to generate good predictions both in-sample and out-of-sample.
The proposed model is flexible and dynamic when both predictive variables and
model coefficients vary over time. It provided good out-of-sample predictions
for the past two recessions and early warning about the COVID-19 recession.

    <title>Household and individual economic responses to different health shocks:
  The role of medical innovations</title>
    <summary>  This study provides new evidence regarding the extent to which medical care
mitigates the economic consequences of various health shocks for the individual
and a wider family. To obtain causal effects, I focus on the role of medical
scientific discoveries and leverage the longitudinal dimension of unique
administrative data for Sweden. The results indicate that medical innovations
strongly mitigate the negative economic consequences of a health shock for the
individual and create spillovers to relatives. Such mitigating effects are
highly heterogeneous across prognoses. These results suggest that medical
innovation substantially reduces the burden of welfare costs yet produces
income inequalities.

    <title>Reinforcement Learning for Economic Policy: A New Frontier?</title>
    <summary>  Agent-based computational economics is a field with a rich academic history,
yet one which has struggled to enter mainstream policy design toolboxes,
plagued by the challenges associated with representing a complex and dynamic
reality. The field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), too, has a rich history, and
has recently been at the centre of several exponential developments. Modern RL
implementations have been able to achieve unprecedented levels of
sophistication, handling previously unthinkable degrees of complexity. This
review surveys the historical barriers of classical agent-based techniques in
economic modelling, and contemplates whether recent developments in RL can
overcome any of them.

    <title>The Nobel Family</title>
    <summary>  Nobel laureates cluster together. 696 of the 727 winners of the Nobel Prize
in physics, chemistry, medicine, and economics belong to one single academic
family tree. 668 trace their ancestry to Emmanuel Stupanus, 228 to Lord
Rayleigh (physics, 1904). Craig Mello (medicine, 2006) counts 51 Nobelists
among his ancestors. Chemistry laureates have the most Nobel ancestors and
descendants, economics laureates the fewest. Chemistry is the central
discipline. Its Nobelists have trained and are trained by Nobelists in other
fields. Nobelists in physics (medicine) have trained (by) others. Economics
stands apart. Openness to other disciplines is the same in recent and earlier
times. The familial concentration of Nobelists is lower now than it used to be.

    <title>The Dynamic Persistence of Economic Shocks</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a model for smoothly varying heterogeneous persistence of
economic data. We argue that such dynamics arise naturally from the dynamic
nature of economic shocks with various degree of persistence. The
identification of such dynamics from data is done using localised regressions.
Empirically, we identify rich persistence structures that change smoothly over
time in two important data sets: inflation, which plays a key role in policy
formulation, and stock volatility, which is crucial for risk and market
analysis.

    <title>Fires and Local Labor Markets</title>
    <summary>  We study the dynamic effects of fires on county labor markets in the US using
a novel geophysical measure of fire exposure based on satellite imagery. We
find increased fire exposure causes lower employment growth in the short and
medium run, with medium-run effects being linked to migration. We also document
heterogeneous effects across counties by education and industrial concentration
levels, states of the business cycle, and fire size. By overcoming challenges
in measuring fire impacts, we identify vulnerable places and economic states,
offering guidance on tailoring relief efforts and contributing to a broader
understanding of natural disasters' economic impacts.

    <title>Modified Verhulst-Solow model for long-term population and economic
  growths</title>
    <summary>  In this study, we analyze the relationship between human population growth
and economic dynamics. To do so, we present a modified version of the Verhulst
model and the Solow model, which together simulate population dynamics and the
role of economic variables in capital accumulation. The model incorporates
support and foraging functions, which participate in the dynamic relationship
between population growth and the creation and destruction of carrying
capacity. The validity of the model is demonstrated using empirical data.

    <title>Packing Peanuts: The Role Synthetic Data Can Play in Enhancing
  Conventional Economic Prediction Models</title>
    <summary>  Packing peanuts, as defined by Wikipedia, is a common loose-fill packaging
and cushioning material that helps prevent damage to fragile items. In this
paper, I propose that synthetic data, akin to packing peanuts, can serve as a
valuable asset for economic prediction models, enhancing their performance and
robustness when integrated with real data. This hybrid approach proves
particularly beneficial in scenarios where data is either missing or limited in
availability. Through the utilization of Affinity credit card spending and
Womply small business datasets, this study demonstrates the substantial
performance improvements achieved by employing a hybrid data approach,
surpassing the capabilities of traditional economic modeling techniques.

    <title>The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation in Economic Dynamics with a
  Non-Smooth Fiscal Policy</title>
    <summary>  We consider a class of economic growth models that includes the classical
Ramsey--Cass--Koopmans capital accumulation model and verify that, under
several assumptions, the value function of the model is the unique viscosity
solution to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. Moreover, we discuss a
solution method for these models using differential inclusion, where the
subdifferential of the value function plays an important role. Next, we present
an assumption under which the value function is a classical solution to the
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation, and show that many economic models satisfy
this assumption. In particular, our result still holds in an economic growth
model in which the government takes a non-smooth Keynesian policy rule.

    <title>On the Analogy of Gauge Theory of Plasticity and Economics</title>
    <summary>  We demonstrated the analogy between Economics and Gauge Theory of Plasticity
and used it to describe the relationship between money supply and inflation at
the economic market. The received equations of economical dynamics in phase
space are similar to the plasticity equations and economic variables - choice,
competition and profit correspond to the state of the market with inflation. We
described the meaning of equations and the role of its variables in the
stabilization mechanism of the market with inflation. The equation of market
equilibrium including the Profit turnover, time changes of competition, capital
and choice was discussed in detail.

    <title>The spatial evolution of economic activities: from theory to estimation</title>
    <summary>  This paper studies the evolution of economic activities using a continuous
time-space aggregation-diffusion model, which encompasses competing effects of
agglomeration and congestion. To bring the model to the real data, a novel
discretization technique over time and space is introduced. This technique
effectively disentangles spatial effects into pure topography, agglomeration,
repulsion, and diffusion forces, which is crucial for developing robust
econometric methods in spatial economics. Our empirical analysis of personal
income across Italian municipalities from 2008 to 2019 validates the model's
primary predictions and demonstrates superior performance compared to the most
common spatial econometric models in the literature.

    <title>Applications of a constrained mechanics methodology in economics</title>
    <summary>  The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained
mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate
physics education. The aim of the paper is: 1. to meet the demand for
illustrative examples suitable for presenting the background of the highly
expanding research field of econophysics even on the undergraduate level and 2.
to enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods
routinely used in mechanics by looking at the well known methodology from the
different perspective of economics. Two constrained dynamic economic problems
are presented using the economic terminology in an intuitive way. First, the
Phillips model of business cycle is presented as a system of forced
oscillations and the general problem of two interacting economies is solved by
the nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of
economical growth is solved as a variational problem with a velocity dependent
constraint using the vakonomic approach. The specifics of the solution
interpretation in economics compared to mechanics is discussed in detail, a
discussion of the nonholonomic and vakonomic approaches to constrained problems
in mechanics and economics is provided and an economic interpretation of the
Lagrange multipliers (possibly surprising for the students of physics) is
carefully explained. The paper can be used by the undergraduate students of
physics interested in interdisciplinary physics applications to get in touch
with current scientific approach to economics based on a physical background or
by university teachers as an attractive supplement to the classical mechanics
lessons.

    <title>Endogenous structural transformation in economic development</title>
    <summary>  This paper extends Xing's (2023abcd) optimal growth models of catching-up
economies from the case of production function switching to that of economic
structure switching and argues how a country develops its economy by endogenous
structural transformation and efficient resource allocation in a market
mechanism. To achieve this goal, the paper first summarizes three attributes of
economic structures from the literature, namely, structurality, durationality,
and transformality, and discuss their implications for methods of economic
modeling. Then, with the common knowledge assumption, the paper extends Xing's
(2023a) optimal growth model that is based on production function switching and
considers an extended Ramsey model with endogenous structural transformation in
which the social planner chooses the optimal industrial structure, recource
allocation with the chosen structure, and consumption to maximize the
representative household's total utility subject to the resource constraint.
The paper next establishes the mathematical underpinning of the static,
dynamic, and switching equilibria. The Ramsey growth model and its equilibria
are then extended to economies with complicated economic structures consisting
of hierarchical production, technology adoption and innovation, infrastructure,
and economic and political institutions. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion of applications of the proposed methodology to economic development
problems in other scenarios.

    <title>Economists' erroneous estimates of damages from climate change</title>
    <summary>  Economists have predicted that damages from global warming will be as low as
2.1% of global economic production for a 3$^\circ$C rise in global average
surface temperature, and 7.9% for a 6$^\circ$C rise. Such relatively trivial
estimates of economic damages -- when these economists otherwise assume that
human economic productivity will be an order of magnitude higher than today --
contrast strongly with predictions made by scientists of significantly reduced
human habitability from climate change. Nonetheless, the coupled economic and
climate models used to make such predictions have been influential in the
international climate change debate and policy prescriptions. Here we review
the empirical work done by economists and show that it severely underestimates
damages from climate change by committing several methodological errors,
including neglecting tipping points, and assuming that economic sectors not
exposed to the weather are insulated from climate change. Most fundamentally,
the influential Integrated Assessment Model DICE is shown to be incapable of
generating an economic collapse, regardless of the level of damages. Given
these flaws, economists' empirical estimates of economic damages from global
warming should be rejected as unscientific, and models that have been
calibrated to them, such as DICE, should not be used to evaluate economic risks
from climate change, or in the development of policy to attenuate damages.

    <title>Estimating economic severity of Air Traffic Flow Management regulations</title>
    <summary>  The development of trajectory-based operations and the rolling network
operations plan in European air traffic management network implies a move
towards more collaborative, strategic flight planning. This opens up the
possibility for inclusion of additional information in the collaborative
decision-making process. With that in mind, we define the indicator for the
economic risk of network elements (e.g., sectors or airports) as the expected
costs that the elements impose on airspace users due to Air Traffic Flow
Management (ATFM) regulations. The definition of the indicator is based on the
analysis of historical ATFM regulations data, that provides an indication of
the risk of accruing delay. This risk of delay is translated into a monetary
risk for the airspace users, creating the new metric of the economic risk of a
given airspace element. We then use some machine learning techniques to find
the parameters leading to this economic risk. The metric is accompanied by an
indication of the accuracy of the delay cost prediction model. Lastly, the
economic risk is transformed into a qualitative economic severity
classification. The economic risks and consequently economic severity can be
estimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an
indicator which can be used by Air Navigation Service Providers to identify
areas which might need the implementation of strategic measures (e.g.,
resectorisation or capacity provision change), and by Airspace Users to
consider operation of routes which use specific airspace regions.

    <title>Amenity complexity and urban locations of socio-economic mixing</title>
    <summary>  Cities host diverse people and their mixing is the engine of prosperity. In
turn, segregation and inequalities are common features of most cities and
locations that enable the meeting of people with different socio-economic
status are key for urban inclusion. In this study, we adopt the concept of
economic complexity to quantify the sophistication of amenity supply at urban
locations. We propose that neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity are
connected to the ability of locations to attract diverse visitors from various
socio-economic backgrounds across the city. We construct the measures of
amenity complexity based on the local portfolio of diverse and non-ubiquitous
amenities in Budapest, Hungary. Socio-economic mixing at visited third places
is investigated by tracing the daily mobility of individuals and by
characterizing their status by the real-estate price of their home locations.
Results suggest that measures of ubiquity and diversity of amenities do not,
but neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity are correlated with the
urban centrality of locations. Urban centrality is a strong predictor of
socio-economic mixing, but both neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity
add further explanatory power to our models. Our work combines urban mobility
data with economic complexity thinking to show that the diversity of
non-ubiquitous amenities, central locations, and the potentials for
socio-economic mixing are interrelated.

    <title>Can AI with High Reasoning Ability Replicate Human-like Decision Making
  in Economic Experiments?</title>
    <summary>  Economic experiments offer a controlled setting for researchers to observe
human decision-making and test diverse theories and hypotheses; however,
substantial costs and efforts are incurred to gather many individuals as
experimental participants. To address this, with the development of large
language models (LLMs), some researchers have recently attempted to develop
simulated economic experiments using LLMs-driven agents, called generative
agents. If generative agents can replicate human-like decision-making in
economic experiments, the cost problem of economic experiments can be
alleviated. However, such a simulation framework has not been yet established.
Considering the previous research and the current evolutionary stage of LLMs,
this study focuses on the reasoning ability of generative agents as a key
factor toward establishing a framework for such a new methodology. A
multi-agent simulation, designed to improve the reasoning ability of generative
agents through prompting methods, was developed to reproduce the result of an
actual economic experiment on the ultimatum game. The results demonstrated that
the higher the reasoning ability of the agents, the closer the results were to
the theoretical solution than to the real experimental result. The results also
suggest that setting the personas of the generative agents may be important for
reproducing the results of real economic experiments. These findings are
valuable for the future definition of a framework for replacing human
participants with generative agents in economic experiments when LLMs are
further developed.

    <title>Reinterpreting Economic Complexity: A co-clustering approach</title>
    <summary>  Economic growth results from countries' accumulation of organizational and
technological capabilities. The Economic and Product Complexity Indices,
introduced as an attempt to measure these capabilities from a country's basket
of exported products, have become popular to study economic development, the
geography of innovation, and industrial policies. Despite this reception, the
interpretation of these indicators proved difficult. Although the original
Method of Reflections suggested a direct interconnection between country and
product metrics, it has been proved that the Economic and Product Complexity
Indices result from a spectral clustering algorithm that separately groups
similar countries or similar products, respectively. This recent approach to
economic and product complexity conflicts with the original one and treats
separately countries and products. However, building on previous
interpretations of the indices and the recent evolution in spectral clustering,
we show that these indices simultaneously identify two co-clusters of similar
countries and products. This viewpoint reconciles the spectral clustering
interpretation of the indices with the original Method of Reflections
interpretation. By proving the often neglected intimate relationship between
country and product complexity, this approach emphasizes the role of a selected
set of products in determining economic development while extending the range
of applications of these indicators in economics.

    <title>Policy Changes and Growth Slowdown: Assessing the Lost Decade of the
  Latin American Miracle</title>
    <summary>  The Latin American region has suffered an economic slowdown since the end of
the commodities boom. Within this context, Chile was the poster child of
economic growth and development up until 2014. Since then, Chile has also been
trapped in a decade of slow economic growth. Chile's sudden slowdown and recent
growth path divergence have posed a puzzle for economic growth and development
economics. This paper examines this slowdown from an empirical perspective and
determines how much can be attributed to internal and external causes. Using a
synthetic control approach and a structural time series Bayesian estimation,
our findings suggest that at least two-thirds of the Chilean slowdown is
attributable to internal causes driven by a policy regime change in 2014, with
external factors playing a secondary role. The net effect of this set of
internal reforms resulted in a nearly 10% reduction in real GDP per capita over
five years and led to a 1.8% decline in average GDP growth rates from 2015 to
2019. Our results are consistent with the literature that establishes that
external shocks can explain only a small fraction of the poor economic
performance of developing countries, suggesting that internal factors are the
primary source of subpar performance. This research sheds light on the
potential effects of policy regime shifts in economic growth, thus providing
valuable insights for development economics and, more specifically, emerging
economies.

    <title>Economic Struggles and Inflation: How Does that affect voting decision?</title>
    <summary>  Economic hardships significantly affect public perception and voting
intentions in general elections. The primary focus of my study is to capture
the degree of influence that individual economic hardships have on their
voting. I utilize the ANES 2024 Pilot Study1 Survey dataset and introduce a
novel composite Inflation Behavior Index (IBR) that captures individuals'
cumulative economic and cost of living experience. To that effect, the primary
objectives of the current study are threefold: first, to develop a composite
economic behavior index from available data and variables to capture the
overall economic experience of U.S. individuals due to ongoing inflation;
second, to examine how this economic behavior impacts political engagement and
voting behavior utilizing appropriate and fitting mathematical models; and
finally which specific personal experiences and perceptions about economy and
cost of living likely to revoke party loyalty in upcoming U.S. presidential
election. My study finds that increased personal economic struggles (pocketbook
voting) due to inflation make it more likely for individuals to express an
intention to vote against the Incumbent even if the Incumbent is from their
self-identified political party. Conversely, having a negative perception of
the national economy (sociotropic voting) is less likely to revoke party
loyalty in the upcoming General election. In simpler terms, voters are more
likely to vote along party lines even if they perceive their party (the
Incumbent) is not handling the economy and cost of living well.

    <title>The Citation Field of Evolutionary Economics</title>
    <summary>  Evolutionary economics has developed into an academic field of its own,
institutionalized around, amongst others, the Journal of Evolutionary Economics
(JEE). This paper analyzes the way and extent to which evolutionary economics
has become an interdisciplinary journal, as its aim was: a journal that is
indispensable in the exchange of expert knowledge on topics and using
approaches that relate naturally with it. Analyzing citation data for the
relevant academic field for the Journal of Evolutionary Economics, we use
insights from scientometrics and social network analysis to find that, indeed,
the JEE is a central player in this interdisciplinary field aiming mostly at
understanding technological and regional dynamics. It does not, however, link
firmly with the natural sciences (including biology) nor to management
sciences, entrepreneurship, and organization studies. Another journal that
could be perceived to have evolutionary acumen, the Journal of Economic Issues,
does relate to heterodox economics journals and is relatively more involved in
discussing issues of firm and industry organization. The JEE seems most keen to
develop theoretical insights.

    <title>Networks of Economic Market Interdependence and Systemic Risk</title>
    <summary>  The dynamic network of relationships among corporations underlies cascading
economic failures including the current economic crisis, and can be inferred
from correlations in market value fluctuations. We analyze the time dependence
of the network of correlations to reveal the changing relationships among the
financial, technology, and basic materials sectors with rising and falling
markets and resource constraints. The financial sector links otherwise weakly
coupled economic sectors, particularly during economic declines. Such links
increase economic risk and the extent of cascading failures. Our results
suggest that firewalls between financial services for different sectors would
reduce systemic risk without hampering economic growth.

    <title>The dynamics of financial stability in complex networks</title>
    <summary>  We address the problem of banking system resilience by applying
off-equilibrium statistical physics to a system of particles, representing the
economic agents, modelled according to the theoretical foundation of the
current banking regulation, the so called Merton-Vasicek model. Economic agents
are attracted to each other to exchange `economic energy', forming a network of
trades. When the capital level of one economic agent drops below a minimum, the
economic agent becomes insolvent. The insolvency of one single economic agent
affects the economic energy of all its neighbours which thus become susceptible
to insolvency, being able to trigger a chain of insolvencies (avalanche). We
show that the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power-law whose
exponent depends on the minimum capital level. Furthermore, we present evidence
that under an increase in the minimum capital level, large crashes will be
avoided only if one assumes that agents will accept a drop in business levels,
while keeping their trading attitudes and policies unchanged. The alternative
assumption, that agents will try to restore their business levels, may lead to
the unexpected consequence that large crises occur with higher probability.

    <title>Inverse Thinking in Economic Theory: A Radical Approach to Economic
  Thinking</title>
    <summary>  The seriousness of the current crisis urgently demands new economic thinking
that breaks the austerity vs. deficit spending circle in economic policy. The
core tenet of the paper is that the most important problems that natural and
social science are facing today are inverse problems, and that a new approach
that goes beyond optimization is necessary. The approach presented here is
radical in the sense that identifies the roots in key assumptions in economic
theory such as optimal behavior and stability to provide an inverse thinking
perspective to economic modeling of use in economic and financial stability
policy. The inverse problem provides a truly multidisciplinary platform where
related problems from different disciplines can be studied under a common
approach with comparable results.

    <title>Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Economic Growth in the Former
  USSR</title>
    <summary>  Historical economic growth in countries of the former USSR is analysed. It is
shown that Unified Growth Theory is contradicted by the data, which were used,
but not analysed, during the formulation of this theory. Unified Growth Theory
does not explain the mechanism of economic growth. It explains the mechanism of
Malthusian stagnation, which did not exist and it explains the mechanism of the
transition from stagnation to growth that did not happen. Unified Growth Theory
is full of stories but it is hard to decide which of them are reliable because
they are based on unprofessional examination of data. The data show that the
economic growth in the former USSR was never stagnant but hyperbolic.
Industrial Revolution did not boost the economic growth in the former USSR.
Unified Growth Theory needs to be revised or replaced by a reliable theory to
reconcile it with data and to avoid creating the unwarranted sense of security
about the current economic growth.

    <title>A Simple Measure of Economic Complexity</title>
    <summary>  Contrary to conventional economic growth theory, which reduces a country's
output to one aggregate variable (GDP), product diversity is central to
economic development, as recent 'economic complexity' research suggests. A
country's product diversity reflects its diversity of knowhow or
'capabilities'. Researchers proposed the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and
the country Fitness index to estimate a country's number of capabilities from
international export data; these measures predict economic growth better than
conventional variables such as human capital. This paper offers a simpler
measure of a country's knowhow, Log Product Diversity (or LPD, the logarithm of
a country's number of products), which can be derived from a one-parameter
combinatorial model of production in which a set of knowhows combine with some
probability to turn raw materials into a product. ECI and log-fitness can be
interpreted theoretically (using the combinatorial model) and empirically as
potentially noisy estimates of LPD; moreover, controlling for natural
resources, the simple measure better explains the cross-country differences in
GDP and in GDP per capita.

    <title>The Postulate of the Three Regimes of Economic Growth Contradicted by
  Data</title>
    <summary>  Economic growth in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, countries of the
former USSR, Africa and Latin America were analysed. It is demonstrated that
the fundamental postulate of the Unified Growth Theory about the existence of
the three regimes of growth (Malthusian regime, post-Malthusian regime and
sustained-growth regime) is contradicted by data. These regimes did not exist.
In particular, there was no escape from the Malthusian trap because there was
no trap. Economic growth in all these regions was not stagnant but hyperbolic.
Unified Growth Theory is fundamentally incorrect. However, this theory is also
dangerously misleading because it claims a transition from the endless epoch of
stagnation to the new era of sustained economic growth, the interpretation
creating the sense of security and a promise of prosperity. The data show that
the opposite is true. Economic growth in the past was sustained and secure.
Now, it is supported by the increasing ecological deficit. The long-term
sustained and secure economic growth has yet to be created. It did not happen
automatically, as suggested incorrectly by the Unified Growth Theory.

    <title>Financial Services, Economic Growth and Well-Being: A Four-Pronged Study</title>
    <summary>  A four-pronged approach to dealing with Social Science Phenomenon is
outlined. This methodology is applied to Financial Services, Economic Growth
and Well-Being. The four prongs are like the four directions for an army
general looking for victory. Just like the four directions, we need to be aware
that there is a degree of interconnectedness in the below four prongs.
-Uncertainty Principle of the Social Sciences -Responsibilities of Fiscal
Janitors -Need for Smaller Organizations -Redirecting Growth that Generates
Garbage The importance of gaining a more profound comprehension of welfare and
delineating its components into those that result from an increase in goods and
services, and hence can be attributed to economic growth, and into those that
are not related to economic growth but lead to a better quality of life, is
highlighted. The reasoning being that economic growth alone is an inadequate
indicator of well-being. Hand in hand with a better understanding of the
characteristics of welfare, comes the need to consider the metrics we currently
have that gauge economic growth and supplement those with measures that capture
well-being more holistically.

    <title>The Impact of Services on Economic Complexity: Service Sophistication as
  Route for Economic Growth</title>
    <summary>  Economic complexity reflects the amount of knowledge that is embedded in the
productive structure of an economy. By combining tools from network science and
econometrics, a robust and stable relationship between a country's productive
structure and its economic growth has been established. Here we report that not
only goods but also services are important for predicting the rate at which
countries will grow. By adopting a terminology which classifies manufactured
goods and delivered services as products, we investigate the influence of
services on the country's productive structure. In particular, we provide
evidence that complexity indices for services are in general higher than those
for goods, which is reflected in a general tendency to rank countries with
developed service sector higher than countries with economy centred on
manufacturing of goods. By focusing on country dynamics based on experimental
data, we investigate the impact of services on the economic complexity of
countries measured in the product space (consisting of both goods and
services). Importantly, we show that diversification of service exports and its
sophistication can provide an additional route for economic growth in both
developing and developed countries.

    <title>Networks as Proxies: a relational approach towards economic complexity
  in the Roman period</title>
    <summary>  Based on the assumption that economic complexity is characterised by the
interactions of economic agents (who) constantly change their actions and
strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create, this paper presents
how network models can be used a proxies for the mapping, quantification and
analysis of Roman economic complexity. Network analysis provides tools to
visualise and analyse the inherent complexity of various types of data and
their combination (archaeological, geographical, textual) or even of a single
piece of evidence. Equally, the relational approach invites to a structural and
quantitative comparison between periods, regions and the economic systems of
polities and empires. An increasing number of proxies of this kind may allow us
to capture the trajectories of economic complexity beyond metaphors.

    <title>Economic Design of Memory-Type Control Charts: The Fallacy of the
  Formula Proposed by Lorenzen and Vance (1986)</title>
    <summary>  The memory-type control charts, such as EWMA and CUSUM, are powerful tools
for detecting small quality changes in univariate and multivariate processes.
Many papers on economic design of these control charts use the formula proposed
by Lorenzen and Vance (1986) [Lorenzen, T. J., &amp; Vance, L. C. (1986). The
economic design of control charts: A unified approach. Technometrics, 28(1),
3-10, DOI: 10.2307/1269598]. This paper shows that this formula is not correct
for memory-type control charts and its values can significantly deviate from
the original values even if the ARL values used in this formula are accurately
computed. Consequently, the use of this formula can result in charts that are
not economically optimal. The formula is corrected for memory-type control
charts, but unfortunately the modified formula is not a helpful tool from a
computational perspective. We show that simulation-based optimization is a
possible alternative method.

    <title>Interpreting Economic Complexity</title>
    <summary>  Two network measures known as the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and Product
Complexity Index (PCI) have provided important insights into patterns of
economic development. We show that the ECI and PCI are equivalent to a spectral
clustering algorithm that partitions a similarity graph into two parts. The
measures are also related to various dimensionality reduction methods and can
be interpreted as vectors that determine distances between nodes based on their
similarity. Our results shed a new light on the ECI's empirical success in
explaining cross-country differences in GDP/capita and economic growth, which
is often linked to the diversity of country export baskets. In fact, countries
with high (low) ECI tend to specialize in high (low) PCI products. We also find
that the ECI and PCI uncover economically informative specialization patterns
across US states and UK regions.

    <title>Logistic map with memory from economic model</title>
    <summary>  A generalization of the economic model of logistic growth, which takes into
account the effects of memory and crises, is suggested. Memory effect means
that the economic factors and parameters at any given time depend not only on
their values at that time, but also on their values at previous times. For the
mathematical description of the memory effects, we use the theory of
derivatives of non-integer order. Crises are considered as sharp splashes
(bursts) of the price, which are mathematically described by the
delta-functions. Using the equivalence of fractional differential equations and
the Volterra integral equations, we obtain discrete maps with memory that are
exact discrete analogs of fractional differential equations of economic
processes. We derive logistic map with memory, its generalizations, and
"economic" discrete maps with memory from the fractional differential
equations, which describe the economic natural growth with competition,
power-law memory and crises.

    <title>Economic complexity and capabilities of Indian States</title>
    <summary>  We explore economic competitiveness of Indian states based on the economic
complexity algorithm, using a pair of coupled non-linear maps to characterize
the Fitness of states and Complexity of products exported by them. We find that
states produce almost all products within their productive capabilities -
diversifying rather than specializing, and that the probability of coexistence
of any pair of productive capabilities is maximized when capabilities are of
similar complexity. Therefore, states require long time horizons to build
complex capabilities and diverse products. We contextualize Fitness using human
development, and find an emergent typology of states. Of most concern are the
states of Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, stuck in vicious feedback cycles of
poor economic complexity and low human development. Economic complexity also
reveals significant concerns with the economic trajectories of Punjab, Gujarat,
and West Bengal. We discuss these emergent trends within the framework of
India's modern economic history.

    <title>The Economic Complexity of US Metropolitan Areas</title>
    <summary>  We calculate measures of economic complexity for US metropolitan areas for
the years 2007-2015 based on industry employment data. We show that the concept
of economic complexity translates well from the cross-country to the regional
setting, and is able to incorporate local as well as traded industries. The
largest cities and the Northeast of the US have the highest average complexity,
while traded industries are more complex than local-serving ones on average,
but with some exceptions. On average, regions with higher complexity have a
higher income per capita, but those regions also were more affected by the
financial crisis. Finally, economic complexity is a significant predictor of
within-decreases in income per capita and population. Our findings highlight
the importance of subnational regions, and particularly metropolitan areas, as
units of economic geography.

    <title>How on Earth: Flourishing in a Not-for-Profit World by 2050</title>
    <summary>  In this book, we outline a model of a non-capitalist market economy based on
not-for-profit forms of business. This work presents both a critique of the
current economic system and a vision of a more socially, economically, and
ecologically sustainable economy. The point of departure is the purpose and
profit-orientation embedded in the legal forms used by businesses (e.g.,
for-profit or not-for-profit) and the ramifications of this for global
sustainability challenges such as environmental pollution, resource use,
climate change, and economic inequality. We document the rapid rise of
not-for-profit forms of business in the global economy and offer a conceptual
framework and an analytical lens through which to view these relatively new
economic actors and their potential for transforming the economy. The book
explores how a market consisting of only or mostly not-for-profit forms of
business might lead to better financial circulation, economic equality, social
well-being, and environmental regeneration as compared to for-profit markets.

    <title>Legal Architecture and Design for Gulf Cooperation Council Economic
  Integration</title>
    <summary>  The Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) is generally
regarded as a success story for economic integration in Arab countries. The
idea of regional integration gained ground by signing the GCC Charter. It
envisioned a closer economic relationship between member states.Although
economic integration among GCC member states is an ambitious step in the right
direction, there are gaps and challenges ahead. The best way to address the
gaps and challenges that exist in formulating integration processes in the GCC
is to start with a clear set of rules and put the necessary mechanisms in
place. Integration attempts must also exhibit a high level of commitment in
order to deflect dynamics of disintegration that have all too often frustrated
meaningful integration in Arab countries. If the GCC can address these issues,
it could become an economic powerhouse within Arab countries and even Asia.

    <title>Coronavirus Perceptions And Economic Anxiety</title>
    <summary>  We provide one of the first systematic assessments of the development and
determinants of economic anxiety at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
Using a global dataset on internet searches and two representative surveys from
the US, we document a substantial increase in economic anxiety during and after
the arrival of the coronavirus. We also document a large dispersion in beliefs
about the pandemic risk factors of the coronavirus, and demonstrate that these
beliefs causally affect individuals' economic anxieties. Finally, we show that
individuals' mental models of infectious disease spread understate non-linear
growth and shape the extent of economic anxiety.

    <title>Shared value economics: an axiomatic approach</title>
    <summary>  The concept of shared value was introduced by Porter and Kramer as a new
conception of capitalism. Shared value describes the strategy of organizations
that simultaneously enhance their competitiveness and the social conditions of
related stakeholders such as employees, suppliers and the natural environment.
The idea has generated strong interest, but also some controversy due to a lack
of a precise definition, measurement techniques and difficulties to connect
theory to practice. We overcome these drawbacks by proposing an economic
framework based on three key aspects: coalition formation, sustainability and
consistency, meaning that conclusions can be tested by means of logical
deductions and empirical applications. The presence of multiple agents to
create shared value and the optimization of both social and economic criteria
in decision making represent the core of our quantitative definition of shared
value. We also show how economic models can be characterized as shared value
models by means of logical deductions. Summarizing, our proposal builds on the
foundations of shared value to improve its understanding and to facilitate the
suggestion of economic hypotheses, hence accommodating the concept of shared
value within modern economic theory.

    <title>An agent-based model for interrelation between COVID-19 outbreak and
  economic activities</title>
    <summary>  As of July, 2020, acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus COVID-19
is spreading over the world and causing severe economic damages. While
minimizing human contact is effective in managing the outbreak, it causes
severe economic losses. Strategies solving this dilemma by considering
interrelation between the spread of the virus and economic activities are in
urgent needs for mitigating the health and economic damage. Here we propose an
abstract agent-based model for the outbreak of COVID-19 in which economic
activities are taken into account. The computational simulation of the model
recapitulated the trade-off between health and economic damage associated with
lockdown measures. Based on the simulation results, we discuss how macroscopic
dynamics of infection and economy emerge from the individuals' behaviours. We
believe our model can serve as a platform for discussing solutions to the
abovementioned dilemma.

    <title>Economic Complexity and Growth: Can value-added exports better explain
  the link?</title>
    <summary>  In economic literature, economic complexity is typically approximated on the
basis of an economy's gross export structure. However, in times of ever
increasingly integrated global value chains, gross exports may convey an
inaccurate image of a country's economic performance since they also
incorporate foreign value-added and double-counted exports. Thus, I introduce a
new empirical approach approximating economic complexity based on a country's
value-added export structure. This approach leads to substantially different
complexity rankings compared to established metrics. Moreover, the explanatory
power of GDP per capita growth rates for a sample of 40 lower-middle- to
high-income countries is considerably higher, even if controlling for typical
growth regression covariates.

    <title>Gender diversity in research teams and citation impact in Economics and
  Management</title>
    <summary>  The aim of this paper is twofold:1)contribute to a better understanding of
the place of women in Economics and Management disciplines by characterizing
the difference in levels of scientific collaboration between men and women at
the specialties level;2) Investigate the relationship between gender diversity
and citation impact in Economics and Management. Our data, extracted from the
Web of Science database, cover global production as indexed in 302 journals in
Economics and 370 journals in Management, with respectively 153 667 and 163 567
articles published between 2008 and 2018. Results show that collaborative
practices between men and women are quite different in Economics and
Management. We also find that there is a positive and significant effect of
gender diversity on the academic impact of publications. Mixed-gender
publications (co-authored by men and women) receive more citations than
non-mixed papers (written by same-gender author teams) or single-author
publications. The effect is slightly stronger in Management. The regression
analysis also indicates that there is, for both disciplines, a small negative
effect on citations received if the corresponding author is a woman.

    <title>Identifying the Main Factors of Iran's Economic Growth using Growth
  Accounting Framework</title>
    <summary>  This paper aims to present empirical analysis of Iranian economic growth from
1950 to 2018 using data from the World Bank, Madison Data Bank, Statistical
Center of Iran, and Central Bank of Iran. The results show that Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capital increased by 2 percent annually during this time,
however this indicator has had a huge fluctuation over time. In addition, the
economic growth of Iran and oil revenue have close relationship with each
other. In fact, whenever oil crises happen, great fluctuation in growth rate
and other indicators happened subsequently. Even though the shares of other
sectors like industry and services in GDP have increased over time, the oil
sector still plays a key role in the economic growth of Iran. Moreover, growth
accounting analysis shows contribution of capital plays a significant role in
economic growth of Iran. Furthermore, based on growth accounting framework the
steady state of effective capital is 4.27 for Iran's economy.

    <title>A Techno-Economic Analysis of Asteroid Mining</title>
    <summary>  Asteroid mining has been proposed as an approach to complement Earth-based
supplies of rare earth metals and supplying resources in space, such as water.
However, existing studies on the economic viability of asteroid mining have
remained rather simplistic and do not provide much guidance on which
technological improvements would be needed for increasing its economic
viability. This paper develops a techno-economic analysis of asteroid mining
with the objective of providing recommendations for future technology
development and performance improvements. Both, in-space resource provision
such as water and return of platinum to Earth are considered. Starting from
first principles of techno-economic analysis, gradually additional economic and
technological factors are added to the analysis model. Applied to mining
missions involving spacecraft reuse, learning curve effect, and multiple
spacecraft, their economic viability is assessed. A sensitivity analysis with
respect to throughput rate, spacecraft mass, and resource price is performed.
Furthermore, a sample asteroid volatile mining architecture based on small
CubeSat-class spacecraft is presented. It is concluded that key technological
drivers for asteroid mining missions are throughput rate, number of spacecraft
per mission, and the rate in which successive missions are conducted.

    <title>Quantifying uncertainty about global and regional economic impacts of
  climate change</title>
    <summary>  The economic impacts of climate change are highly uncertain. Two of the most
important uncertainties are the sensitivity of the climate system and the
so-called damage functions, which relate climate change to economic damages and
benefits. Despite broad awareness of these uncertainties, it is unclear which
of them is most important, both on the global as well as the regional level.
Here we apply different damage functions to data from climate models with
vastly different climate sensitivities, and find that uncertainty in both
climate sensitivity and economic damage per degree of warming are of similar
importance for the global economic impact. Increasing the climate sensitivity
or the sensitivity of the damage function both increases the economic damages
globally. Yet, at the country-level the effect varies depending on the initial
temperature as well as how much the country warms. Our findings emphasise the
importance of including these uncertainties in estimates of future economic
impacts, as they both are vital for the resulting impacts and thus policy
implications.

    <title>Universal Database for Economic Complexity</title>
    <summary>  We present an integrated database suitable for the investigations of the
Economic development of countries by using the Economic Fitness and Complexity
framework. Firstly, we implement machine learning techniques to reconstruct the
database of Trade of Services and we integrate it with the database of the
Trade of the physical Goods, generating a complete view of the International
Trade and denoted the Universal database. Using this data, we derive a
statistically significant network of interaction of the Economic activities,
where preferred paths of development and clusters of High-Tech industries
naturally emerge. Finally, we compute the Economic Fitness, an algorithmic
assessment of the competitiveness of countries, removing the unexpected
misbehaviour of Economies under-represented by the sole consideration of the
Trade of the physical Goods.

lead the African sub-region into the deplorable economic situation. The study
observed that the region leapfrogged prematurely to import substitution, export
promotion, and global value chains. Based on these past experiences, the region
should adopt a gradual approach in responding to the COVID-19 economic

    <title>Aproximacion a los estudios sobre la economia en la Segunda Republica
  espanola hasta 1936 -- Approaches to the economics of the Spanish Second
  Republic prior to 1936</title>
    <summary>  Macroeconomic data on the Spanish economy during the Second Republic is not
accurate, the interpretation of historical events from the figures obtained is
divergent and misleading. Hasty laws were enacted in attempts to resolve social
problems arising mainly from deep economic inequalities, but they were often
nothing more than declarations of good intentions. Spain suffered in the
aftermath of the international economic downturn as it began to be felt at the
end of the dictatorship of General Primo de Rivera. Economic policy was
developed under the Constitution,but, despite the differences between the first
and second biennium, there was a tendency to maintain the guidelines from the
previous stage and in general, sometimes unfairly, it aimed at least to avoid
the destabilization of the financial system. Nonetheless, it ultimately failed
to achieve its goals, mainly because of the frequent changes of government
mediated by a social crisis of greater significance that had relegated economic
issues into the background.

    <title>The Economics and Econometrics of Gene-Environment Interplay</title>
    <summary>  Economists and social scientists have debated the relative importance of
nature (one's genes) and nurture (one's environment) for decades, if not
centuries. This debate can now be informed by the ready availability of genetic
data in a growing number of social science datasets. This paper explores the
potential uses of genetic data in economics, with a focus on estimating the
interplay between nature (genes) and nurture (environment). We discuss how
economists can benefit from incorporating genetic data into their analyses even
when they do not have a direct interest in estimating genetic effects. We argue
that gene--environment (GxE) studies can be instrumental for (i) testing
economic theory, (ii) uncovering economic or behavioral mechanisms, and (iii)
analyzing treatment effect heterogeneity, thereby improving the understanding
of how (policy) interventions affect population subgroups. We introduce the
reader to essential genetic terminology, develop a conceptual economic model to
interpret gene-environment interplay, and provide practical guidance to
empirical researchers.

    <title>The Policy Implications of Economic Complexity</title>
    <summary>  In recent years economic complexity has grown into an active field of
fundamental and applied research. Yet, despite important advances, the policy
implications of economic complexity remain unclear or misunderstood. Here I
organize the policy implications of economic complexity in a framework grounded
on 4 Ws: what approaches, focused on identifying target activities and/or
locations; when approaches, focused on timing support for related and unrelated
activities; where approaches, focused on the geographic diffusion of knowledge;
and who approaches, focused on the role played by agents of structural change.
The goal of this paper is to provide a framework that groups, organizes, and
clarifies the policy implications of economic complexity to facilitate its
continued use in regional and international development.

    <title>Economic complexity and inequality at the national and regional level</title>
    <summary>  Recent studies have found evidence of a negative association between economic
complexity and inequality at the country level. Moreover, evidence suggests
that sophisticated economies tend to outsource products that are less desirable
(e.g. in terms of wage and inequality effects), and instead focus on complex
products requiring networks of skilled labor and more inclusive institutions.
Yet the negative association between economic complexity and inequality on a
coarse scale could hide important dynamics at a fine-grained level. Complex
economic activities are difficult to develop and tend to concentrate spatially,
leading to 'winner-take-most' effects that spur regional inequality in
countries. Large, complex cities tend to attract both high- and low-skills
activities and workers, and are also associated with higher levels of
hierarchies, competition, and skill premiums. As a result, the association
between complexity and inequality reverses at regional scales; in other words,
more complex regions tend to be more unequal. Ideas from polarization theories,
institutional changes, and urban scaling literature can help to understand this
paradox, while new methods from economic complexity and relatedness can help
identify inclusive growth constraints and opportunities.

    <title>Journal of Economic Literature codes classification system (JEL)</title>
    <summary>  The Journal of Economic Literature codes classification system (JEL)
published by the American Economic Association (AEA) is the de facto standard
classification system for research literature in economics. The JEL
classification system is used to classify articles, dissertations, books, book
reviews, and working papers in EconLit, a database maintained by the AEA. Over
time, it has evolved and extended to a system with over 850 subclasses. This
paper reviews the history and development of the JEL classification system,
describes the current version, and provides a selective overview of its uses
and applications in research. The JEL codes classification system has been
adopted by several publishers, and their instructions are reviewed. There are
interesting avenues for future research as the JEL classification system has
been surprisingly little used in existing bibliometric and scientometric
research as well as in library classification systems.

    <title>The explosive value of the networks</title>
    <summary>  Networks have always played a special role for human beings in shaping social
relations, forming public opinion, and driving economic equilibria. Nowadays,
online networked platforms dominate digital markets and capitalization
leader-boards, while social networks drive public discussion. Despite the
importance of networks in many economic and social domains (economics,
sociology, anthropology, psychology,...), the knowledge about the laws that
dominate their dynamics is still scarce and fragmented. Here, we analyse a wide
set of online networks (those financed by advertising) by investigating their
value dynamics from several perspectives: the type of service, the geographic
scope, the merging between networks, and the relationship between economic and
financial value. The results show that the networks are dominated by strongly
nonlinear dynamics. The existence of non-linearity is often underestimated in
social sciences because it involves contexts that are difficult to deal with,
such as the presence of multiple equilibria -- some of which are unstable. Yet,
these dynamics must be fully understood and addressed if we aim to understand
the recent evolution in the economic, political and social milieus, which are
precisely characterised by corner equilibria (e.g., polarization,
winner-take-all solutions, increasing inequality) and nonlinear patterns.

    <title>Multidimensional Economic Complexity and Inclusive Green Growth</title>
    <summary>  To achieve inclusive green growth, countries need to consider a multiplicity
of economic, social, and environmental factors. These are often captured by
metrics of economic complexity derived from the geography of trade, thus
missing key information on innovative activities. To bridge this gap, we
combine trade data with data on patent applications and research publications
to build models that significantly and robustly improve the ability of economic
complexity metrics to explain international variations in inclusive green
growth. We show that measures of complexity built on trade and patent data
combine to explain future economic growth and income inequality and that
countries that score high in all three metrics tend to exhibit lower emission
intensities. These findings illustrate how the geography of trade, technology,
and research combine to explain inclusive green growth.

    <title>Regional Disparities and Economic Growth in Ukraine</title>
    <summary>  This research is devoted to assessing regional economic disparities in
Ukraine, where regional economic inequality is a crucial issue the country
faces in its medium and long-term development, recently, even in the short
term. We analyze the determinants of regional economic growth, mainly
industrial and agricultural productions, population, human capital, fertility,
migration, and regional government expenditures. Using panel data estimations
from 2004 to 2020 for 27 regions of Ukraine, our results show that the gaps
between regions in Ukraine have widened last two decades. Natural resource
distribution, agricultural and industrial productions, government spending, and
migration can explain the disparities. We show that regional government
spending is highly concentrated in Kyiv, and the potential of the other
regions, especially the Western ones, needs to be used sufficiently. Moreover,
despite its historical and economic opportunity, the East region performed
little development during the last two decades. The inefficient and
inconsistent regional policies played a crucial role in these disparities.

    <title>Monetary Policy and Economic Growth in Developing Countries: A
  Literature Review</title>
    <summary>  This article conducts a literature review on the topic of monetary policy in
developing countries and focuses on the effectiveness of monetary policy in
promoting economic growth and the relationship between monetary policy and
economic growth. The literature review finds that the activities of central
banks in developing countries are often overlooked by economic models, but
recent studies have shown that there are many factors that can affect the
effectiveness of monetary policy in these countries. These factors include the
profitability of central banks and monetary unions, the independence of central
banks in their operations, and lags, rigidities, and disequilibrium analysis.
The literature review also finds that studies on the topic have produced mixed
results, with some studies finding that monetary policy has a limited or
non-existent impact on economic growth and others finding that it plays a
crucial role. The article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
current state of research in this field and to identify areas for future study.

    <title>Machine Learning for Economics Research: When What and How?</title>
    <summary>  This article provides a curated review of selected papers published in
prominent economics journals that use machine learning (ML) tools for research
and policy analysis. The review focuses on three key questions: (1) when ML is
used in economics, (2) what ML models are commonly preferred, and (3) how they
are used for economic applications. The review highlights that ML is
particularly used to process nontraditional and unstructured data, capture
strong nonlinearity, and improve prediction accuracy. Deep learning models are
suitable for nontraditional data, whereas ensemble learning models are
preferred for traditional datasets. While traditional econometric models may
suffice for analyzing low-complexity data, the increasing complexity of
economic data due to rapid digitalization and the growing literature suggests
that ML is becoming an essential addition to the econometrician's toolbox.

    <title>Economic Origins of the Sicilian Mafia: A Simulation Feedback Model</title>
    <summary>  This chapter develops a feedback economic model that explains the rise of the
Sicilian mafia in the 19th century. Grounded in economic theory, the model
incorporates causal relationships between the mafia activities, predation, law
enforcement, and the profitability of local businesses. Using computational
experiments with the model, we explore how different factors and feedback
effects impact the mafia activity levels. The model explains important
historical observations such as the emergence of the mafia in wealthier regions
and its absence in the poorer districts despite the greater levels of banditry.

    <title>The Determinants of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) A Panel Data
  Analysis for the Emerging Asian Economies</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we explore the economic, institutional, and
political/governmental factors in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
inflows in the emerging twenty-four Asian economies. To examine the significant
determinants of FDI, the study uses panel data for a period of seventeen years
(2002-2018). The panel methodology enables us to deal with endogeneity and
other issues. Multiple regression models are done for empirical evidence. The
study focuses on a holistic approach and considers different variables under
three broad areas: economic, institutional, and political aspects. The
variables include Market Size, Trade Openness, Inflation, Natural Resource,
Lending Rate, Capital Formation as economic factors and Business Regulatory
Environment and Business Disclosure Index as institutional factors and
Political Stability, Government Effectiveness, and Rule of Law as political
factors. The empirical findings show most of the economic factors significantly
affect FDI inflows whereas Business Disclosure is the only important
institutional variable. Moreover, political stability has a significant
positive impact in attracting foreign capital flow though the impact of
government effectiveness is found insignificant. Overall, the economic factors
prevail strongly compared to institutional and political factors.

    <title>How does the national new area impact the local economy? -- An empirical
  analysis from Zhoushan</title>
    <summary>  To empirically study the policy impact of a National New Area on the local
economy, this paper evaluates the effect of the Zhoushan Archipelago New Area
on local GDP growth rate and economic efficiency. By collecting input and
output data from 20 prefectural-level cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui
provinces from 1995 to 2015, we estimate the economic efficiency of these
cities using data envelopment analysis. Subsequently, we construct
counterfactuals for Zhoushan by selecting comparable cities from the dataset,
excluding Zhoushan, and applying a panel data approach. The difference between
the actual and counterfactual values for GDP growth rate and economic
efficiency in Zhoushan is analyzed to determine the treatment effect of the
National New Area policy. The research reveals that in the initial four years,
the New Area policy enhanced Zhoushan's economic efficiency but negatively
affected its GDP growth rate. This influence gradually disappeared after four
years. Further analysis suggests that the policy's effect on GDP growth rate
varies with the level of economic development in different regions, having a
more substantial impact in less developed areas. Therefore, we conclude that
establishing a New Area in relatively undeveloped zones is more advantageous.

    <title>Economic impacts of a drastic gas supply shock and short-term mitigation
  strategies</title>
    <summary>  The Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 entailed the threat of a
drastic and sudden reduction of natural gas supply to the European Union. This
paper presents a techno-economic analysis of the consequences of a sudden gas
supply shock to Austria, one of the most dependent countries on imports of
Russian gas. Our analysis comprises (a) a detailed assessment of supply and
demand side countermeasures to mitigate the immediate shortfall in Russian gas
imports, (b) a mapping of the net reduction in gas supply to industrial sectors
to quantify direct economic shocks and expected relative reductions in gross
output and (c) the quantification of higher-order economic impacts through
using a dynamic out-of-equilibrium input-output model. Our results show that
potential economic consequences can range from relatively mild to highly
severe, depending on the implementation and success of counteracting mitigation
measures. We find that securing alternative gas imports, storage management,
and incentivizing fuel switching represent the most important short-term policy
levers to mitigate the adverse impacts of a sudden import stop.

    <title>Competitive market for multiple firms and economic crisis</title>
    <summary>  The origin of economic crises is a key problem for economics. We present a
model of long-run competitive markets to show that the multiplicity of
behaviors in an economic system, over a long time scale, emerge as statistical
regularities (perfectly competitive markets obey Bose-Einstein statistics and
purely monopolistic-competitive markets obey Boltzmann statistics) and that how
interaction among firms influences the evolutionary of competitive markets. It
has been widely accepted that perfect competition is most efficient. Our study
shows that the perfectly competitive system, as an extreme case of competitive
markets, is most efficient but not stable, and gives rise to economic crises as
society reaches full employment. In the economic crisis revealed by our model,
many firms condense (collapse) into the lowest supply level (zero supply,
namely bankruptcy status), in analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation. This
curious phenomenon arises because perfect competition (homogeneous
competitions) equals symmetric (indistinguishable) investment direction, a fact
abhorred by nature. Therefore, we urge the promotion of monopolistic
competition (heterogeneous competitions) rather than perfect competition. To
provide early warning of economic crises, we introduce a resolving index of
investment, which approaches zero in the run-up to an economic crisis. On the
other hand, our model discloses, as a profound conclusion, that the
technological level for a long-run social or economic system is proportional to
the freedom (disorder) of this system; in other words, technology equals the
entropy of system. As an application of this new concept, we give a possible
answer to the Needham question: "Why was it that despite the immense
achievements of traditional China it had been in Europe and not in China that
the scientific and industrial revolutions occurred?"

    <title>Metabolic fluxes and value production</title>
    <summary>  Metabolic fluxes in cells are governed by physical, physiological, and
economic principles. Here I assume an optimal allocation of enzyme resources
and postulate a general principle for metabolism: each enzyme must convert less
valuable into more valuable metabolites to justify its own cost. The "values",
called economic potentials, describe the individual contributions of
metabolites to cell fitness. Local value production implies that the cost of an
enzyme must be balanced by a benefit, given by the economic potential
difference the catalysed reaction multiplied by the flux. Flux profiles that
satisfy this principle - i.e. for which consistent potentials can be found -
are called economical. Economical fluxes must lead from lower to higher
economic potentials, so certain flux cycles are incompatible with any choice of
economic potentials and can be excluded. To obtain economical flux profiles,
non-beneficial local patterns, called futile motifs, can be systematically
removed from a given flux distribution. The principle of local value production
resembles thermodynamic principles and complements them in models. Here I
describe a modelling framework called Value Balance Analysis (VBA) that uses
the two principles and yields the same solution as enzyme cost minimisation (in
kinetic models) and flux cost minimisation (in FBA). Given an economical flux
distribution, kinetic models in enzyme-optimal states and with these fluxes can
be constructed systematically. VBA justifies the principle of minimal fluxes
and the exclusion of futile cycles, predicts enzymes that could be plausible
targets for regulation, provides criteria for the usage of enzymes and
pathways, and explains the choice between high-yield and low-yield flux modes.

    <title>On the Use of Computer Programs as Money</title>
    <summary>  Money is a technology for promoting economic prosperity. Over history money
has become increasingly abstract, it used to be hardware, gold coins and the
like, now it is mostly software, data structures located in banks. Here I
propose the logical conclusion of the abstraction of money: to use as money the
most general form of information - computer programs. The key advantage that
using programs for money (program-money) adds to the technology of money is
agency. Program-money is active and thereby can fully participate in economics
as economic agents. I describe the three basic technologies required to
implement program-money: computational languages/logics to unambiguously
describe the actions and interactions of program-money; computational
cryptography to ensure that only the correct actions and interactions are
performed; and a distributed computational environment in which the money can
execute. I demonstrate that most of the technology for program-money has
already been developed. The adoption of program-money transfers responsibility
from human economic agents to money itself and has great potential economic
advantages over the current passive form of money. For example in
microeconomics, adding agency to money will simplify the exchange of ownership,
ensure money is only used legally, automate the negotiation and forming of
contracts, etc. Similar advantages occur in macroeconomics, where for example
the control of the money supply could be transferred from central banks to
money. It is also possible to envisage money that is not owned by any external
human agent or corporation. One motivation for this is to force economic
systems to behave more rationally and/or more like a specific economic theory,
thereby increasing the success of economic forecasting.

    <title>Economic geography and the scaling of urban and regional income in India</title>
    <summary>  We undertake an exploration of the economic income (Gross Domestic Product,
GDP) of Indian districts and cities based on scaling analyses of the dependence
of these quantities on associated population size. Scaling analysis provides a
straightforward method for the identification of network effects in
socioeconomic organization, which are the tell-tale of cities and urbanization.
For districts, a sub-state regional administrative division in India, we find
almost linear scaling of GDP with population, a result quite different from
urban functional units in other national contexts. Using deviations from
scaling, we explore the behavior of these regional units to find strong
distinct geographic patterns of economic behavior. We characterize these
patterns in detail and connect them to the literature on regional economic
development for a diverse subcontinental nation such as India. Given the
paucity of economic data for Urban Agglomerations in India, we use a set of
assumptions to create a new dataset of GDP based on districts, for large
cities. This reveals superlinear scaling of income with city size, as expected
from theory, while displaying similar underlying patterns of economic geography
observed for district economic performance. This analysis of the economic
performance of Indian cities is severely limited by the absence of
higher-fidelity, direct city level economic data. We discuss the need for
standardized and consistent estimates of the size and change in urban economies
in India, and point to a number of proxies that can be explored to develop such
indicators.

    <title>Economic complexity of prefectures in Japan</title>
    <summary>  Every nation prioritizes the inclusive economic growth and development of all
regions. However, we observe that economic activities are clustered in space,
which results in a disparity in per-capita income among different regions. A
complexity-based method was proposed by Hidalgo and Hausmann [PNAS 106,
10570-10575 (2009)] to explain the large gaps in per-capita income across
countries. Although there have been extensive studies on countries' economic
complexity using international export data, studies on economic complexity at
the regional level are relatively less studied. Here, we study the industrial
sector complexity of prefectures in Japan based on the basic information of
more than one million firms. We aggregate the data as a bipartite network of
prefectures and industrial sectors. We decompose the bipartite network as a
prefecture-prefecture network and sector-sector network, which reveals the
relationships among them. Similarities among the prefectures and among the
sectors are measured using a metric. From these similarity matrices, we cluster
the prefectures and sectors using the minimal spanning tree technique.The
computed economic complexity index from the structure of the bipartite network
shows a high correlation with macroeconomic indicators, such as per-capita
gross prefectural product and prefectural income per person. We argue that this
index reflects the present economic performance and hidden potential of the
prefectures for future growth.

    <title>Estimation of economic losses due to milk fever and efficiency gains if
  prevented: evidence from Haryana, India</title>
    <summary>  Calcium (Ca) requirement increases tenfold upon parturition in dairy cows &amp;
buffaloes and its deficiency leads to a condition called milk fever (MF).
Estimation of losses is necessary to understand the depth of the problem and
design preventive measures. How much is the economic loss due to MF? What will
be the efficiency gain if MF is prevented at the advent of a technology? We
answer these questions using survey data and official statistics employing
economic surplus model. MF incidence in sample buffaloes and cows was 19% and
28%, respectively. Total economic losses were calculated as a sum total of
losses from milk production, mortality of animals and treatment costs. Yearly
economic loss due to MF was estimated to be INR 1000 crores (US$ 137 million)
in Haryana. Value of milk lost had the highest share in total economic losses
(58%), followed by losses due to mortality (29%) and treatment costs (13%).
Despite lower MF incidence, losses were higher in buffaloes due to higher milk
prices and market value of animals. The efficiency gain accruing to producers
if MF is prevented, resulting from increased milk production at decreased costs
was estimated at INR 10990 crores (US$ 1.5 billion). As the potential gain if
prevented is around 10 times the economic losses, this study calls for the use
of preventive technology against MF.

    <title>An Economic Analysis on the Potential and Steady Growth of China: a
  Practice Based on the Dualistic System Economics in China</title>
    <summary>  The existing theorization of development economics and transition economics
is probably inadequate and perhaps even flawed to accurately explain and
analyze a dual economic system such as that in China. China is a country in the
transition of dual structure and system. The reform of its economic system has
brought off a long period of transformation. The allocation of factors is
subjected to the dualistic regulation of planning or administration and market
due to the dualistic system, and thus the signal distortion will be a commonly
seen existence. From the perspective of balanced and safe growth, the
institutional distortions of population birth, population flow, land
transaction and housing supply, with the changing of export, may cause great
influences on the production demand, which includes the iterative contraction
of consumption, the increase of export competitive cost, the widening of
urban-rural income gap, the transferring of residents' income and the crowding
out of consumption. In view of the worldwide shift from a conservative model
with more income than expenditure to the debt-based model with more expenditure
than income and the need for loose monetary policy, we must explore a basic
model that includes variables of debt and land assets that affecting money
supply and price changes, especially in China, where the current debt ratio is
high and is likely to rise continuously. Based on such a logical framework of
dualistic system economics and its analysis method, a preliminary calculation
system is formed through the establishment of models.

    <title>Constrained scenarios for twenty-first century human population size
  based on the empirical coupling to economic growth</title>
    <summary>  Growth in the global human population this century will have momentous
consequences for societies and the environment. Population growth has come with
higher aggregate human welfare, but also climate change and biodiversity loss.
Based on the well-established empirical association and plausible causal
relationship between economic and population growth, we devised a novel method
for forecasting population based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
Although not mechanistically causal, our model is intuitive, transparent,
replicable, and grounded on historical data. Our central finding is that a
richer world is likely to be associated with a lower population, an effect
especially pronounced in rapidly developing countries. In our baseline
scenario, where GDP per capita follows a business-as-usual trajectory, global
population is projected to reach 9.2 billion in 2050 and peak in 2062. With 50%
higher annual economic growth, population peaks even earlier, in 2056, and
declines to below 8 billion by the end of the century. Without any economic
growth after 2020, however, the global population will grow to 9.9 billion in
2050 continue rising thereafter. Economic growth has the largest effect on
low-income countries. The gap between the highest and lowest GDP scenarios
reaches almost 4 billion by 2100. Education and family planning are important
determinants of population growth, but economic growth is also likely to be a
driver of slowing population growth by changing incentives for childbearing.
Since economic growth could slow population growth, it will offset
environmental impacts stemming from higher per-capita consumption of food,
water, and energy, and work in tandem with technological innovation.

    <title>A simple model suggesting economically rational sample-size choice
  drives irreproducibility</title>
    <summary>  Several systematic studies have suggested that a large fraction of published
research is not reproducible. One probable reason for low reproducibility is
insufficient sample size, resulting in low power and low positive predictive
value. It has been suggested that insufficient sample-size choice is driven by
a combination of scientific competition and 'positive publication bias'. Here
we formalize this intuition in a simple model, in which scientists choose
economically rational sample sizes, balancing the cost of experimentation with
income from publication. Specifically, assuming that a scientist's income
derives only from 'positive' findings (positive publication bias) and that
individual samples cost a fixed amount, allows to leverage basic statistical
formulas into an economic optimality prediction. We find that if effects have
i) low base probability, ii) small effect size or iii) low grant income per
publication, then the rational (economically optimal) sample size is small.
Furthermore, for plausible distributions of these parameters we find a robust
emergence of a bimodal distribution of obtained statistical power and low
overall reproducibility rates, both matching empirical findings. Finally, we
explore conditional equivalence testing as a means to align economic incentives
with adequate sample sizes. Overall, the model describes a simple mechanism
explaining both the prevalence and the persistence of small sample sizes, and
is well suited for empirical validation. It proposes economic rationality, or
economic pressures, as a principal driver of irreproducibility and suggests
strategies to change this.

    <title>The Possible Effects of Personal Income Tax and Value Added Tax on
  Consumer Behaviors</title>
    <summary>  In economics literature, it is accepted that all people are rational and they
try to maximize their utilities as possible as they can. In addition, economic
theories are formed with the assumptions not suitable to real life. For
instance, indifference curves are drawn with the assumptions that there are two
goods, people are rational, more is preferred to less and so on. Hence, the
consumer behaviors are guessed according to this analysis. Nevertheless, these
are invalid in real life. And this inconsistencey are examined by behavioral
economics and neuroeconomics. Behavioral economics claims that people can
behave what they are not expected since people can be irrational, their
willpower is limited and altruistic behaviors can be seen and they can give
more value to what they own. As a result of these, consumer behaviors become
more different than that of economic theory. In addition to behavioral
economics, neuroeconomics also examines consumer behaviors more differently
than mainstream economic theory. It emphasizes the people using prefrontial
cortex of the brain are more rational than the people using hippocampus of the
brain. Therefore, people can make illogical choices compared to economic
theory. In these cases, levying taxes such as personal income tax or value
added tax can be ineffective or effective. In other words, the effect becomes
ambigious. Hence,the hypothesis that if government desires to levy personal
income tax or value added tax, it makes a detailed research in terms of
productivity of taxes forms the fundamental of this study.

    <title>How Covid-19 Pandemic Changes the Theory of Economics?</title>
    <summary>  During its history, the ultimate goal of economics has been to develop
similar frameworks for modeling economic behavior as invented in physics. This
has not been successful, however, and current state of the process is the
neoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using a static
framework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic
quantities because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a
positive profit maximizing flow of production does not exist. Due to these
problems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of a profit-seeking
firm where the adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important,
currently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future
bankruptcies of firms due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can
solve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several
parameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model
of a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the
reasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in
physics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is
more important for the development of economics than pure mathematics. (JEL

    <title>Modeling the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of bounded rationality and
  economic constraints</title>
    <summary>  The analogies between economics and classical mechanics can be extended from
constrained optimization to constrained dynamics by formalizing economic
(constraint) forces and economic power in analogy to physical (constraint)
forces in Lagrangian mechanics. In the differential-algebraic equation
framework of General Constrained Dynamics (GCD), households, firms, banks, and
the government employ forces to change economic variables according to their
desire and their power to assert their interest. These ex-ante forces are
completed by constraint forces from unanticipated system constraints to yield
the ex-post dynamics. The flexible out-of-equilibrium model can combine
Keynesian concepts such as the balance sheet approach and slow adaptation of
prices and quantities with bounded rationality (gradient climbing) and
interacting agents discussed in behavioral economics and agent-based models.
The framework integrates some elements of different schools of thought and
overcomes some restrictions inherent to optimization approaches, such as the
assumption of markets operating in or close to equilibrium. Depending on the
parameter choice for power relations and adaptation speeds, the model
nevertheless can converge to a neoclassical equilibrium, and reacts to an
austerity shock in a neoclassical or post-Keynesian way.

    <title>Associational and plausible causal effects of COVID-19 public health
  policies on economic and mental distress</title>
    <summary>  Background The COVID-19 pandemic has increased mental distress globally. The
proportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points.
Disentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19
cases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different
mitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress.
Methods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021
data to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19.
We combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly:
COVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public
policies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic
and mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent
variables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path
coefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to
February 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the
U.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies
where businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19
cases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the
same period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental
distress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity
decreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential
causal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression
is 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%. Thus, we show that period t-1 COVID-19 case
information, behavior, and economic distress may be causally associated with
pandemic related period t mental distress.

    <title>Economic state classification and portfolio optimisation with
  application to stagflationary environments</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the current fears of a potentially stagflationary global
economic environment, this paper uses new and recently introduced mathematical
techniques to study multivariate time series pertaining to country inflation
(CPI), economic growth (GDP) and equity index behaviours. We begin by assessing
the temporal evolution among various economic phenomena, and complement this
analysis with `economic driver analysis,' where we decouple country economic
trajectories and determine what is most important in their association. Next,
we study the temporal self-similarity of global inflation, growth and equity
index returns to identify the most anomalous historic periods, and windows in
the past that are most similar to current market dynamics. We then introduce a
new algorithm to construct economic state classifications and compute an
economic state integral, where countries are determined to belong in one of
four candidate states based on their inflation and growth behaviours. Finally,
we implement a decade-by-decade portfolio optimisation to determine which
equity indices and portfolio assets have been most beneficial in maximising
portfolio risk-adjusted returns in various market conditions. This could be of
great interest to those looking for asset allocation guidance in the current
period of high economic uncertainty.

    <title>A meta-analysis of the total economic impact of climate change</title>
    <summary>  Earlier meta-analyses of the economic impact of climate change are updated
with more data, with three new results: (1) The central estimate of the
economic impact of global warming is always negative. (2) The confidence
interval about the estimates is much wider. (3) Elicitation methods are most
pessimistic, econometric studies most optimistic. Two previous results remain:
(4) The uncertainty about the impact is skewed towards negative surprises. (5)
Poorer countries are much more vulnerable than richer ones. A meta-analysis of
the impact of weather shocks reveals that studies, which relate economic growth
to temperature levels, cannot agree on the sign of the impact whereas studies,
which make economic growth a function of temperature change do agree on the
sign but differ an order of magnitude in effect size. The former studies posit
that climate change has a permanent effect on economic growth, the latter that
the effect is transient. The impact on economic growth implied by studies of
the impact of climate change is close to the growth impact estimated as a
function of weather shocks. The social cost of carbon shows a similar pattern
to the total impact estimates, but with more emphasis on the impacts of
moderate warming in the near and medium term.

    <title>Weak Supervision in Analysis of News: Application to Economic Policy
  Uncertainty</title>
    <summary>  The need for timely data analysis for economic decisions has prompted most
economists and policy makers to search for non-traditional supplementary
sources of data. In that context, text data is being explored to enrich
traditional data sources because it is easy to collect and highly abundant. Our
work focuses on studying the potential of textual data, in particular news
pieces, for measuring economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Economic policy
uncertainty is defined as the public's inability to predict the outcomes of
their decisions under new policies and future economic fundamentals.
Quantifying EPU is of great importance to policy makers, economists, and
investors since it influences their expectations about the future economic
fundamentals with an impact on their policy, investment and saving decisions.
Most of the previous work using news articles for measuring EPU are either
manual or based on a simple keyword search. Our work proposes a machine
learning based solution involving weak supervision to classify news articles
with regards to economic policy uncertainty. Weak supervision is shown to be an
efficient machine learning paradigm for applying machine learning models in low
resource settings with no or scarce training sets, leveraging domain knowledge
and heuristics. We further generated a weak supervision based EPU index that we
used to conduct extensive econometric analysis along with the Irish
macroeconomic indicators to validate whether our generated index foreshadows
weaker macroeconomic performance

    <title>The unequal effects of the health-economy tradeoff during the COVID-19
  pandemic</title>
    <summary>  The potential tradeoff between health outcomes and economic impact has been a
major challenge in the policy making process during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Epidemic-economic models designed to address this issue are either too
aggregate to consider heterogeneous outcomes across socio-economic groups, or,
when sufficiently fine-grained, not well grounded by empirical data. To fill
this gap, we introduce a data-driven, granular, agent-based model that
simulates epidemic and economic outcomes across industries, occupations, and
income levels with geographic realism. The key mechanism coupling the epidemic
and economic modules is the reduction in consumption demand due to fear of
infection. We calibrate the model to the first wave of COVID-19 in the New York
metropolitan area, showing that it reproduces key epidemic and economic
statistics, and then examine counterfactual scenarios. We find that: (a) both
high fear of infection and strict restrictions similarly harm the economy but
reduce infections; (b) low-income workers bear the brunt of both the economic
and epidemic harm; (c) closing non-customer-facing industries such as
manufacturing and construction only marginally reduces the death toll while
considerably increasing unemployment; and (d) delaying the start of protective
measures does little to help the economy and worsens epidemic outcomes in all
scenarios. We anticipate that our model will help designing effective and
equitable non-pharmaceutical interventions that minimize disruptions in the
face of a novel pandemic.

    <title>Peace Dividends: The Economic Effects of Colombia's Peace Agreement</title>
    <summary>  The last decades have seen a resurgence of armed conflict around the world,
renewing the need for durable peace agreements. In this paper, I evaluate the
economic effects of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and
the largest guerrilla group in the country, the FARC, putting an end to one of
the longest and most violent armed conflicts in recent history. Using a
difference-in-difference strategy comparing municipalities that historically
had FARC presence and those with presence of a similar, smaller guerrilla
group, the ELN, before and after the start of a unilateral ceasefire by the
FARC, I establish three sets of results. First, violence indicators
significantly and sizably decreased in historically FARC municipalities.
Second, despite this large reduction in violence, I find precisely-estimated
null effects across a variety of economic indicators, suggesting no effect of
the peace agreement on economic activity. Furthermore, I use a sharp
discontinuity in eligibility to the government's flagship business and job
creation program for conflict-affected areas to evaluate the policy's impact,
also finding precisely-estimated null effects on the same economic indicators.
Third, I present evidence that suggests the reason why historically FARC
municipalities could not reap the economic benefits from the reduction in
violence is a lack of state capacity, caused both by their low initial levels
of state capacity and the lack of state entry post-ceasefire. These results
indicate that peace agreements require complementary investments in state
capacity to yield an economic dividend.

    <title>Export complexity, industrial complexity and regional economic growth in
  Brazil</title>
    <summary>  Research on productive structures has shown that economic complexity
conditions economic growth. However, little is known about which type of
complexity, e.g., export or industrial complexity, matters more for regional
economic growth in a large emerging country like Brazil. Brazil exports natural
resources and agricultural goods, but a large share of the employment derives
from services, non-tradables, and within-country manufacturing trade. Here, we
use a large dataset on Brazil's formal labor market, including approximately
100 million workers and 581 industries, to reveal the patterns of export
complexity, industrial complexity, and economic growth of 558 micro-regions
between 2003 and 2019. Our results show that export complexity is more evenly
spread than industrial complexity. Only a few -- mainly developed urban places
-- have comparative advantages in sophisticated services. Regressions show that
a region's industrial complexity is a significant predictor for 3-year growth
prospects, but export complexity is not. Moreover, economic complexity in
neighboring regions is significantly associated with economic growth. The
results show export complexity does not appropriately depict Brazil's knowledge
base and growth opportunities. Instead, promoting the sophistication of the
heterogeneous regional industrial structures and development spillovers is a
key to growth.

    <title>Actualised and future changes in regional economic growth through sea
  level rise</title>
    <summary>  This study investigates the long-term economic impact of sea-level rise (SLR)
on coastal regions in Europe, focusing on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Using a
novel dataset covering regional SLR and economic growth from 1900 to 2020, we
quantify the relationships between SLR and regional GDP per capita across 79
coastal EU &amp; UK regions. Our results reveal that the current SLR has already
negatively influenced GDP of coastal regions, leading to a cumulative 4.7% loss
at 39 cm of SLR. Over the 120 year period studied, the actualised impact of SLR
on the annual growth rate is between -0.02% and 0.04%. Extrapolating these
findings to future climate and socio-economic scenarios, we show that in the
absence of additional adaptation measures, GDP losses by 2100 could range
between -6.3% and -20.8% under the most extreme SLR scenario (SSP5-RCP8.5
High-end Ice, or -4.0% to -14.1% in SSP5-RCP8.5 High Ice). This statistical
analysis utilising a century-long dataset, provides an empirical foundation for
designing region-specific climate adaptation strategies to mitigate economic
damages caused by SLR. Our evidence supports the argument for strategically
relocating assets and establishing coastal setback zones when it is
economically preferable and socially agreeable, given that protection
investments have an economic impact.

    <title>Using satellite imagery to monitor remote rural economies at high
  frequency</title>
    <summary>  Despite global progress in reducing extreme poverty, stubborn pockets remain,
often in remote and fragile regions. A fundamental obstacle to further progress
is that remoteness and fragility also constrain our ability to monitor economic
conditions. Using satellite imagery, we develop a new approach to monitor
economic activity at periodic markets, focal points for rural trade throughout
history and much of the world today. We describe how to detect marketplaces
without pre-existing maps and how to construct an up-to-weekly measure of their
activity. We show that we successfully detect marketplaces and that activity
correlates with other measures of economic activity, captures seasonal
patterns, and responds to local weather and conflict. Drawing on high
frequency, globally available imagery, our approach enables real-time
monitoring of economic activity independent of ground conditions. .

    <title>Applications of Small-World Networks to some Socio-economic Systems</title>
    <summary>  Small-world networks (SWN) are found to be closer to the real social systems
than both regular and random lattices. Then, a model for the evolution of
economic systems is generalized to SWN. The Sznajd model for the two-state
opinion formation problem is applied to SWN. Then a simple definition of
leaders is included. These models explain some socio-economic aspects.

    <title>Is it Possible to Describe Economical Phenomena by Methods of
  Statistical Physics of Open Systems?</title>
    <summary>  The methods of statistical physics of open systems are used for describing
the time dependence of economic characteristics (income, profit, cost, supply,
currency etc.) and their correlations with each other. Nonlinear equations
(analogies of known reaction-diffusion, kinetic, Langevin equation) describing
appearance of bifurcations, self-sustained oscillational processes,
self-organizations in economic phenomena are offered.

    <title>Econophysics and Financial-Economic Monitoring</title>
    <summary>  The author solves two problems: formation of object of econophysics, creation
of the general theory of financial-economic monitoring. In the first problem he
studied two fundamental tasks: a choice of conceptual model and creation of
axiomatic base. It is accepted, that the conceptual model of econophysics is a
concrete definition of entropy conceptual model. Financial and economic
monitoring is considered as monitoring of flows on entropy manifold of phase
space - on a Diffusion field.

    <title>Pricing, liquidity and the control of dynamic systems in finance and
  economics</title>
    <summary>  The paper discusses various practical consequences of treating economics and
finance as an inherently dynamic and chaotic system. On the theoretical side
this looks at the general applicability of the market-making pricing approach
to economics in general. The paper also discuses the consequences of the
endogenous creation of liquidity and the role of liquidity as a state variable.
On the practical side, proposals are made for reducing chaotic behaviour in
both housing markets and stock markets.

    <title>Notes on socio-economic transparency mechanisms</title>
    <summary>  Clearly, socio-economic freedom requires some extent of transparency
regarding the implications of choices. In this paper, we review some
established mechanisms for achieving such transparency, without any claim to
completeness, and briefly discuss potential future directions. Our
investigation is structured by four "challenges" under which we subsume the
various requirements on, and approaches to, socio-economic transparency
mechanisms. One main focus is on the inference, i.e., statistical, aspect of
such mechanisms.

    <summary>  We propose and develop an algebraic approach to revealed preference. Our
approach dispenses with non algebraic structure, such as topological
assumptions. We provide algebraic axioms of revealed preference that subsume
previous, classical revealed preference axioms, as well as generate new axioms
for behavioral theories, and show that a data set is rationalizable if and only
if it is consistent with an algebraic axiom.

    <title>Causal Inference in Network Economics</title>
    <summary>  Network economics is the study of a rich class of equilibrium problems that
occur in the real world, from traffic management to supply chains and two-sided
online marketplaces. In this paper we explore causal inference in network
economics, building on the mathematical framework of variational inequalities,
which is a generalization of classical optimization. Our framework can be
viewed as a synthesis of the well-known variational inequality formalism with
the broad principles of causal inference

    <title>Improving the Economic Complexity Index</title>
    <summary>  How much knowledge is there in an economy? In recent years, data on the mix
of products that countries export has been used to construct measures of
economic complexity that estimate the knowledge available in an economy and
predict future economic growth. Here we introduce a new and simpler metric of
economic complexity (ECI+) that measures the total exports of an economy
corrected by how difficult it is to export each product. We use data from 1973
to 2013 to compare the ability of ECI+, the Economic Complexity Index (ECI),
and Fitness complexity, to predict future economic growth using 5, 10, and
20-year panels in a pooled OLS, a random effects model, and a fixed effects
model. We find that ECI+ outperforms ECI and Fitness in its ability to predict
economic growth and in the consistency of its estimators across most
econometric specifications. On average, one standard deviation increase in ECI+
is associated with an increase in annualized growth of about 4% to 5%. We then
combine ECI+ with measures of physical capital, human capital, and
institutions, to find a robust model of economic growth. The ability of ECI+ to
predict growth, and the value of its coefficient, is robust to these controls.
Also, we find that human capital, political stability, and control of
corruption; are positively associated with future economic growth, and that
income is negatively associated with growth, in agreement with the traditional
growth literature. Finally, we use ECI+ to generate economic growth predictions
for the next 20 years and compare these predictions with the ones obtained
using ECI and Fitness. These findings improve the methods available to estimate
the knowledge intensity of economies and predict future economic growth.

    <title>Canonical Correlation and Assortative Matching: A Remark</title>
    <summary>  In the context of the Beckerian theory of marriage, when men and women match
on a single-dimensional index that is the weighted sum of their respective
multivariate attributes, many papers in the literature have used linear
canonical correlation, and related techniques, in order to estimate these
weights. We argue that this estimation technique is inconsistent and suggest
some solutions.

    <summary>  The article considers the practice of applying the cluster approach in Russia
as a tool for overcoming economic inequality between Russian regions. The
authors of the study analyze the legal framework of cluster policy in Russia,
noting that its successful implementation requires a little more time than
originally planned. Special attention is paid to the experience of
benchmarking.

    <title>Submission Fees in Risk-Taking Contests</title>
    <summary>  This paper investigates stochastic continuous time contests with a twist: the
designer requires that contest participants incur some cost to submit their
entries. When the designer wishes to maximize the (expected) performance of the
top performer, a strictly positive submission fee is optimal. When the designer
wishes to maximize total (expected) performance, either the highest submission
fee or the lowest submission fee is optimal.

    <title>Classicals versus Keynesians: Fifty Distinctions between Two Major
  Schools of Economic Thought</title>
    <summary>  Macroeconomics essentially discusses macroeconomic phenomena from the
perspectives of various schools of economic thought, each of which takes
different views on how macroeconomic agents make decisions and how the
corresponding markets operate. Therefore, developing a clear, comprehensive
understanding of how and in what ways these schools of economic thought differ
is a key and a prerequisite for economics students to prosper academically and
professionally in the discipline. This becomes even more crucial as economics
students pursue their studies toward higher levels of education and graduate
school, during which students are expected to attain higher levels of Bloom's
taxonomy, including analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and creation. Teaching the
distinctions and similarities of the two major schools of economic thought has
never been an easy task to undertake in the classroom. Although the reason for
such a hardship can be multi-fold, one reason has undoubtedly been students'
lack of a holistic view on how the two mainstream economic schools of thought
differ. There is strong evidence that students make smoother transition to
higher levels of education after building up such groundwork, on which they can
build further later on (e.g. Didia and Hasnat, 1998; Marcal and Roberts, 2001;
Islam, et al., 2008; Green, et al., 2009; White, 2016). The paper starts with a
visual spectrum of various schools of economic thought, and then narrows down
the scope to the classical and Keynesian schools, i.e. the backbone of modern
macroeconomics. Afterwards, a holistic table contrasts the two schools in terms
of 50 aspects. Not only does this table help economics students enhance their
comprehension, retention, and critical-thinking capability, it also benefits
macroeconomic instructors to ...

    <title>Dynamic Arrangements in Economic Theory: Level-Agnostic Representations</title>
    <summary>  If Economics is understood as the study of the interactions among intentional
agents, being rationality the main source of intentional behavior, the
mathematical tools that it requires must be extended to capture systemic
effects. Here we choose an alternative toolbox based on Category Theory. We
examine potential {\em level-agnostic} formalisms, presenting three categories,
$\mathcal{PR}$, $\mathcal{G}$ and an encompassing one, $\mathcal{PR-G}$. The
latter allows for representing dynamic rearrangements of the interactions among
different agents.

related to the quantification of the social costs and the issue, related to the
defining of the circular economy concept as a theoretical model. The analysis
is based on the methodology of the new institutional economics, which fact
distinguishes it from the many other circular economy analysis based on the
neo-classical methodological apparatus.

    <title>Thermodynamics and Economics</title>
    <summary>  The application of principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to
economic systems is considered in a broad historical perspective, extending
from prehistoric times to the present day. The hypothesis of maximum entropy
production (MEP), which has been used to model complex physical systems such as
fluid turbulence and the climate of the Earth and other planets, may be applied
to human economic activity, subject to constraints such as the availability of
suitable technology, and the nature of political control. Applied to the
current abundance of available energy from fossil fuel reserves, MEP is shown
to have significant policy implications.

    <title>Directed or Undirected? A New Index to Check for Directionality of
  Relations in Socio-Economic Networks</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a simple procedure to decide whether the
empirically-observed adjacency or weights matrix, which characterizes the graph
underlying a socio-economic network, is sufficiently symmetric (respectively,
asymmetric) to justify an undirected (respectively, directed) network analysis.
We introduce a new index that satisfies two main properties. First, it can be
applied to both binary or weighted graphs. Second, once suitably standardized,
it distributes as a standard normal over all possible adjacency/weights
matrices. To test the index in practice, we present an application that employs
a set of well-known empirically-observed social and economic networks.

    <title>L.V.Kantorovich and Linear Programming</title>
    <summary>  I want to write about what I know and remember about the activities of Leonid
Vital'evich Kantorovich, an outstanding scientist of the 20th century; about
his dramatic struggle for recognition of his mathematical economic theories;
about the initial stage of the history of linear programming; about beautuful
Kantorovich metric, about the creation of a new area of mathematical activity
related to economic applications, which is called sometimes operation research,
sometimes mathematical economics, sometimes linear and convex programming, or
economic cybernetics, etc.; about its place in the modern mathematical
landscape; and, finally, about several personal impressions of this
distinguished scientist. The notes in no way pretend to exhaust these topics.

    <title>Economic Amplifier - A New Econophysics Model</title>
    <summary>  Most of the econometric and econophysics models have been borrowed from the
statistical physics, and as a cosequence, a new interdisciplinary science
called econophysics has emerged. In this paper we planned to extend the analogy
between different economic processes or phenomena and processes and phenomena
from different fields of physics, other than statistical physics. On the basis
of the economic development process and amplification phenomenon analogy, a new
econophysics model, named economic amplifier, on the electronic amplification
principle from applied physics was proposed und largely analyzed.

    <title>Statistical thermodynamics of economic systems</title>
    <summary>  We formulate thermodynamics of economic systems in terms of an arbitrary
probability distribution for a conserved economic quantity. As in statistical
physics, thermodynamic macroeconomic variables emerge as the mean value of
microeconomic variables and their determination is reduced to the computation
of the partition function, starting from an arbitrary function. Explicit
hypothetical examples are given which include linear and nonlinear economic
systems, as well as multiplicative systems such as those dominated by a Pareto
law distribution. We propose to use the formalism of phase transitions to study
severe changes of macroeconomic variables.

    <title>Theoretical frameworks for neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice</title>
    <summary>  Intertemporal choice has drawn attention in behavioral economics,
econophysics, and neuroeconomics. Recent studies in mainstream economics have
mainly focused on inconsistency in intertemporal choice (dynamic
inconsistency); while impulsivity/impatience in intertemporal choice has been
extensively studied in behavioral economics of addiction. However, recent
advances in neuroeconomic and econophysical studies on intertemporal choice
have made it possible to study both impulsivity and inconsistency in
intertemporal choice within a unified framework. In this paper I propose the
new frameworks for investigations into neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice.
The importance of studying neurochemical and neuroendocrinological modulations
of intertemporal choice and time-perception (e.g. serotonin, dopamine,
cortisol, testosterone, and epinephrine) is emphasized.

    <title>Reciprocity as the foundation of Financial Economics</title>
    <summary>  This paper argues that the fundamental principle of contemporary financial
economics is balanced reciprocity, not the principle of utility maximisation
that is important in economics more generally. The argument is developed by
analysing the mathematical Fundamental Theory of Asset Pricing with reference
to the emergence of mathematical probability in the seventeenth century in the
context of the ethical assessment of commercial contracts. This analysis is
undertaken within a framework of Pragmatic philosophy and Virtue Ethics. The
purpose of the paper is to mitigate future financial crises by reorienting
financial economics to emphasise the objectives of market stability and social
cohesion rather than individual utility maximisation.

    <title>On Agents and Equilibria</title>
    <summary>  This essay discusses the advantages of a probabilistic agent-based approach
to questions in theoretical economics, from the nature of economic agents, to
the nature of the equilibria supported by their interactions. One idea we
propose is that "agents" are meta-individual, hierarchically structured
objects, that include as irreducible components groupings of different
dimensions. We also explore the effects of non-ergodicity, by constructing a
simple stochastic model for the contingent nature of economic interactions.

    <title>Information equilibrium as an economic principle</title>
    <summary>  A general information equilibrium model in the case of ideal information
transfer is defined and then used to derive the relationship between supply
(information destination) and demand (information source) with the price as the
detector of information exchange between demand and supply. We recover the
properties of the traditional economic supply-demand diagram. Information
equilibrium is then applied to macroeconomic problems, recovering some common
macroeconomic models in particular limits like the AD-AS model, IS-LM model (in
a low inflation limit), the quantity theory of money (in a high inflation
limit) and the Solow-Swan growth model. Information equilibrium results in
empirically accurate models of inflation and interest rates, and can be used to
motivate a 'statistical economics', analogous to statistical mechanics for
thermodynamics.

    <title>Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Economic Growth in Africa</title>
    <summary>  One of the fundamental postulates of the Unified Growth Theory is the claimed
existence of three distinctly different regimes of economic growth governed by
three distinctly different mechanisms of growth. However, Galor also proposed
that the timing of these regimes is different for developed countries and for
less-developed countries. Africa is the perfect example of economic growth in
less-developed countries. The data used by Galor, but never properly
investigated, are now analysed. They turn out to be in dramatic contradiction
of this theory.

    <title>Economics cannot isolate itself from political theory: a mathematical
  demonstration</title>
    <summary>  The purpose of this paper is to provide a confession of sorts from an
economist to political science and philosophy. A confession of the weaknesses
of the political position of the economist. It is intended as a guide for
political scientists and philosophers to the ostensible policy criteria of
economics, and an illustration of an argument that demonstrates
logico-mathematically, therefore incontrovertibly, that any policy statement by
an economist contains, or is, a political statement. It develops an inescapable
compulsion that the absolute primacy and priority of political theory and
philosophy in the development of policy criteria must be recognised. Economic
policy cannot be divorced from politics as a matter of mathematical fact, and
rather, as Amartya Sen has done, it ought embrace political theory and
philosophy.

    <title>Assessing the Economics of Customer-Sited Multi-Use Energy Storage</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents an approach to assess the economics of customer-sited
energy storage systems (ESSs) which are owned and operated by a customer. The
ESSs can participate in frequency regulation and spinning reserve markets, and
are used to help the customer consume available renewable energy and reduce
electricity bill. A rolling-horizon approach is developed to optimize the
service schedule, and the resulting costs and revenues are used to assess
economics of the ESSs. The economic assessment approach is illustrated with
case studies, from which we obtain some new observations on profitability of
the customer- sited multi-use ESSs.

    <title>Deep Learning in (and of) Agent-Based Models: A Prospectus</title>
    <summary>  A very timely issue for economic agent-based models (ABMs) is their empirical
estimation. This paper describes a line of research that could resolve the
issue by using machine learning techniques, using multi-layer artificial neural
networks (ANNs), or so called Deep Nets. The seminal contribution by Hinton et
al. (2006) introduced a fast and efficient training algorithm called Deep
Learning, and there have been major breakthroughs in machine learning ever
since. Economics has not yet benefited from these developments, and therefore
we believe that now is the right time to apply Deep Learning and multi-layered
neural networks to agent-based models in economics.

    <title>Why we like the ECI+ algorithm</title>
    <summary>  Recently a measure for Economic Complexity named ECI+ has been proposed by
Albeaik et al. We like the ECI+ algorithm because it is mathematically
identical to the Fitness algorithm, the measure for Economic Complexity we
introduced in 2012. We demonstrate that the mathematical structure of ECI+ is
strictly equivalent to that of Fitness (up to normalization and rescaling). We
then show how the claims of Albeaik et al. about the ability of Fitness to
describe the Economic Complexity of a country are incorrect. Finally, we
hypothesize how the wrong results reported by these authors could have been
obtained by not iterating the algorithm.

    <title>Optimal Decentralized Economical-sharing Criterion and Scheme for
  Microgrid</title>
    <summary>  In order to address the economical dispatch problem in islanded microgrid,
this letter proposes an optimal criterion and two decentralized
economical-sharing schemes. The criterion is to judge whether global optimal
economical-sharing can be realized via a decentralized manner. On the one hand,
if the system cost functions meet this criterion, the corresponding
decentralized droop method is proposed to achieve the global optimal dispatch.
Otherwise, if the system does not meet this criterion, a modified method to
achieve suboptimal dispatch is presented. The advantages of these methods are
convenient,effective and communication-less.

    <title>A Physical Review on Currency</title>
    <summary>  A theoretical self-sustainable economic model is established based on the
fundamental factors of production, consumption, reservation and reinvestment,
where currency is set as a unconditional credit symbol serving as transaction
equivalent and stock means. Principle properties of currency are explored in
this ideal economic system. Physical analysis reveals some facts that were not
addressed by traditional monetary theory, and several basic principles of ideal
currency are concluded: 1. The saving-replacement is a more primary function of
currency than the transaction equivalents; 2. The ideal efficiency of currency
corresponds to the least practical value; 3. The contradiction between constant
face value of currency and depreciable goods leads to intrinsic inflation.

    <title>Towards equation of state for a market: A thermodynamical paradigm of
  economics</title>
    <summary>  Foundations of equilibrium thermodynamics are the equation of state (EoS) and
four postulated laws of thermodynamics. We use equilibrium thermodynamics
paradigms in constructing the EoS for microeconomics system that is a market.
This speculation is hoped to be first step towards whole pictures of
thermodynamical paradigm of economics.

    <title>Population Growth and Economic Development in Bangladesh: Revisited
  Malthus</title>
    <summary>  Bangladesh is the 2nd largest growing country in the world in 2016 with 7.1%
GDP growth. This study undertakes an econometric analysis to examine the
relationship between population growth and economic development. This result
indicates population growth adversely related to per capita GDP growth, which
means rapid population growth is a real problem for the development of
Bangladesh.

    <summary>  The main purpose of the study is to develop the model for transaction costs
measurement in the Collective Waste Recovery Systems. The methodology of New
Institutional Economics is used in the research. The impact of the study is
related both to the enlargement of the limits of the theory about the
interaction between transaction costs and social costs and to the
identification of institutional failures of the European concept for circular
economy. A new model for social costs measurement is developed. Keywords:

    <title>A Practical Approach to Social Learning</title>
    <summary>  Models of social learning feature either binary signals or abstract signal
structures often deprived of micro-foundations. Both models are limited when
analyzing interim results or performing empirical analysis. We present a method
of generating signal structures which are richer than the binary model, yet are
tractable enough to perform simulations and empirical analysis. We demonstrate
the method's usability by revisiting two classical papers: (1) we discuss the
economic significance of unbounded signals Smith and Sorensen (2000); (2) we
use experimental data from Anderson and Holt (1997) to perform econometric
analysis. Additionally, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the
occurrence of action cascades.

    <title>Electoral systems and international trade policy</title>
    <summary>  We develop a simple theoretic game a model to analyze the relationship
between electoral sys tems and governments' choice in trade policies. We show
that existence of international pressure or foreign lobby changes a
government's final decision on trade policy, and trade policy in countries with
proportional electoral system is more protectionist than in countries with
majoritarian electoral system. Moreover, lobbies pay more to affect the trade
policy outcomes in countries with proportional representation systems.

    <title>How Much Income Inequality Is Too Much?</title>
    <summary>  We propose a highly schematic economic model in which, in some cases, wage
inequalities lead to higher overall social welfare. This is due to the fact
that high earners can consume low productivity, non essential products, which
allows everybody to remain employed even when the productivity of essential
goods is high and producing them does not require everybody to work. We derive
a relation between heterogeneities in technologies and the minimum Gini
coefficient required to maximize global welfare. Stronger inequalities appear
to be economically unjustified. Our model may shed light on the role of
non-essential goods in the economy, a topical issue when thinking about the
post-Covid-19 world.

    <title>Optimal Trade-Off Between Economic Activity and Health During an
  Epidemic</title>
    <summary>  This paper considers a simple model where a social planner can influence the
spread-intensity of an infection wave, and, consequently, also the economic
activity and population health, through a single parameter. Population health
is assumed to only be negatively affected when the number of simultaneously
infected exceeds health care capacity. The main finding is that if (i) the
planner attaches a positive weight on economic activity and (ii) it is more
harmful for the economy to be locked down for longer than shorter time periods,
then the optimal policy is to (weakly) exceed health care capacity at some
time.

    <title>Teaching Economics with Interactive Browser-Based Models</title>
    <summary>  Interactive simulation toolkits come in handy when teaching macroeconomic
models by facilitating an easy understanding of underlying economic concepts
and offering an intuitive approach to the models' comparative statics. Based on
the example of the IS-LM model, this paper demonstrates innovative
browser-based features well-suited for the shift in education to online
platforms accelerated by COVID-19. The free and open-source code can be found

    <title>The public debt multiplier</title>
    <summary>  We study the effects on economic activity of a pure temporary change in
government debt and the relationship between the debt multiplier and the level
of debt in an overlapping generations framework. The debt multiplier is
positive but quite small during normal times while it is much larger during
crises. Moreover, it increases with the steady state level of debt. Hence, the
call for fiscal consolidation during recessions seems ill-advised. Finally, a
rise in the steady state debt-to-GDP level increases the steady state real
interest rate providing more room for manoeuvre to monetary policy to fight
deflationary shocks.

    <title>Synthetic Data Generation for Economists</title>
    <summary>  As more tech companies engage in rigorous economic analyses, we are
confronted with a data problem: in-house papers cannot be replicated due to use
of sensitive, proprietary, or private data. Readers are left to assume that the
obscured true data (e.g., internal Google information) indeed produced the
results given, or they must seek out comparable public-facing data (e.g.,
Google Trends) that yield similar results. One way to ameliorate this
reproducibility issue is to have researchers release synthetic datasets based
on their true data; this allows external parties to replicate an internal
researcher's methodology. In this brief overview, we explore synthetic data
generation at a high level for economic analyses.

    <title>Climate Change Adaptation in the British Columbia Wine Industry Can
  carbon sequestration technology lower the B.C. Wine Industry's greenhouse gas
  emissions?</title>
    <summary>  The purpose of this study is to measure the benefits and costs of using
biochar, a carbon sequestration technology, to reduce the B.C Wine Industry's
carbon emissions. An economic model was developed to calculate the value-added
for each of the three sectors that comprise the BC Wine industry. Results
indicate that each sector of the wine value chain is potentially profitable,
with 9,000 tonnes of CO2 sequestered each year. The study is unique in that it
demonstrates that using biochar, produced from wine industry waste, to
sequester atmospheric CO2 can be both profitable and environmentally
sustainable.

    <title>Does Foreign Debt Contribute to Economic Growth?</title>
    <summary>  We study the relationship between foreign debt and GDP growth using a panel
dataset of 50 countries from 1997 to 2015. We find that economic growth
correlates positively with foreign debt and that the relationship is causal in
nature by using the sovereign credit default swap spread as an instrumental
variable. Furthermore, we find that foreign debt increases investment and then
GDP growth in subsequent years. Our findings suggest that lower sovereign
default risks lead to higher foreign debt contributing to GDP growth more in
OECD than non-OECD countries.

    <title>Spatial Discrete Choice and Spatial Limited Dependent Variable Models: a
  review with an emphasis on the use in Regional Health Economics</title>
    <summary>  Despite spatial econometrics is now considered a consolidated discipline,
only in recent years we have experienced an increasing attention to the
possibility of applying it to the field of discrete choices (e.g. Smirnov, 2010
for a recent review) and limited dependent variable models. In particular, only
a small number of papers introduced the above-mentioned models in Health
Economics. The main purpose of the present paper is to review the different
methodological solutions in spatial discrete choice models as they appeared in
several applied fields by placing an emphasis on the health economics
applications.

    <title>Economic MPC of Nonlinear Systems with Non-Monotonic Lyapunov Functions
  and Its Application to HVAC Control</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a Lyapunov-based economic MPC scheme for nonlinear sytems
with non-monotonic Lyapunov functions. Relaxed Lyapunov-based constraints are
used in the MPC formulation to improve the economic performance. These
constraints will enforce a Lyapunov decrease after every few steps. Recursive
feasibility and asymptotical convergence to the steady state can be achieved
using Lyapunov-like stability analysis. The proposed economic MPC can be
applied to minimize energy consumption in HVAC control of commercial buildings.
The Lyapunov-based constraints in the online MPC problem enable the tracking of
the desired set-point temperature. The performance is demonstrated by a virtual
building composed of two adjacent zones.

    <title>Business Cycles in Economics</title>
    <summary>  The business cycles are generated by the oscillating macro-/micro-/nano-
economic output variables in the economy of the scale and the scope in the
amplitude/frequency/phase/time domains in the economics. The accurate forward
looking assumptions on the business cycles oscillation dynamics can optimize
the financial capital investing and/or borrowing by the economic agents in the
capital markets. The book's main objective is to study the business cycles in
the economy of the scale and the scope, formulating the Ledenyov unified
business cycles theory in the Ledenyov classic and quantum econodynamics.

    <title>Potential Outcome and Directed Acyclic Graph Approaches to Causality:
  Relevance for Empirical Practice in Economics</title>
    <summary>  In this essay I discuss potential outcome and graphical approaches to
causality, and their relevance for empirical work in economics. I review some
of the work on directed acyclic graphs, including the recent "The Book of Why,"
by Pearl and MacKenzie. I also discuss the potential outcome framework
developed by Rubin and coauthors, building on work by Neyman. I then discuss
the relative merits of these approaches for empirical work in economics,
focusing on the questions each answer well, and why much of the the work in
economics is closer in spirit to the potential outcome framework.

    <title>Behavioural Macroeconomic Policy: New perspectives on time inconsistency</title>
    <summary>  This paper brings together divergent approaches to time inconsistency from
macroeconomic policy and behavioural economics. Behavioural discount functions
from behavioural microeconomics are embedded into a game-theoretic analysis of
temptation versus enforcement to construct an encompassing model, nesting
combinations of time consistent and time inconsistent preferences. The analysis
presented in this paper shows that, with hyperbolic/quasihyperbolic
discounting, the enforceable range of inflation targets is narrowed. This
suggests limits to the effectiveness of monetary targets, under certain
conditions. The paper concludes with a discussion of monetary policy
implications, explored specifically in the light of current macroeconomic
policy debates.

    <title>Rise of the Kniesians: The professor-student network of Nobel laureates
  in economics</title>
    <summary>  The paper presents the professor-student network of Nobel laureates in
economics. 74 of the 79 Nobelists belong to one family tree. The remaining 5
belong to 3 separate trees. There are 350 men in the graph, and 4 women. Karl
Knies is the central-most professor, followed by Wassily Leontief. No classical
and few neo-classical economists have left notable descendants. Harvard is the
central-most university, followed by Chicago and Berlin. Most candidates for
the Nobel prize belong to the main family tree, but new trees may arise for the
students of Terence Gorman and Denis Sargan.

    <title>Formal Statement of the Decision-making Support Problem in the
  Management of Municipal Social and Economic Development</title>
    <summary>  This article deals with the process of managing the social and economic
development of municipal formations. It highlights characteristics and key
issues that arise during management at the municipal level. In order to
minimize the impact of the described issues, it is suggested to consider
municipal social and economic development as a semistructured system which is
modelled using a semantic network. As a result, it is concluded that a rating
of indicators for assessing social and economic development needs to be created
in order to determine the effectiveness and correlation with the targeted
indicators.

    <title>The Behavioral Economics of Intrapersonal Conflict: A Critical
  Assessment</title>
    <summary>  Preferences often change -- even in short time intervals -- due to either the
mere passage of time (present-biased preferences) or changes in environmental
conditions (state-dependent preferences). On the basis of the empirical
findings in the context of state-dependent preferences, we critically discuss
the Aristotelian view of unitary decision makers in economics and urge a more
Heraclitean perspective on human decision-making. We illustrate that the
conceptualization of preferences as present-biased or state-dependent has very
different normative implications under the Aristotelian view, although both
concepts are empirically hard to distinguish. This is highly problematic, as it
renders almost any paternalistic intervention justifiable.

    <title>Airport Capacity and Performance in Europe -- A study of transport
  economics, service quality and sustainability</title>
    <summary>  The purpose of this dissertation is to present an overview of the operational
and financial performance of airports in Europe. In benchmarking studies,
airports are assessed and compared with other airports based on key indicators
from a technical and an economic point of view. The interest lies primarily in
the question, which key figures can best measure the perception of quality of
service from the point of view of the passenger for the services at an airport.
