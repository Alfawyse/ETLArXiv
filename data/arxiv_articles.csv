disproportionately entering computer science education & fields. Existing data
suggests this is a plausible trend, yet no research has been done into exactly
why. As computer science education (traditional schooling or self-taught
methods) is integral to working in computer science fields, a simple research
survey was conducted to gather data on 138 trans people's experiences with
computer science & computer science education. This article's purpose is to
shed insight on the motivations for trans individuals choosing computer science
paths, while acting as a basis and call to action for further research.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05986v1,FAIR and Open Computer Science Research Software,"  In computational science and in computer science, research software is a
central asset for research. Computational science is the application of
computer science and software engineering principles to solving scientific
problems, whereas computer science is the study of computer hardware and
software design.
  The Open Science agenda holds that science advances faster when we can build
on existing results. Therefore, research software has to be reusable for
advancing science. Thus, we need proper research software engineering for
obtaining reusable and sustainable research software. This way, software
engineering methods may improve research in other disciplines. However,
research in software engineering and computer science itself will also benefit
from reuse when research software is involved.
  For good scientific practice, the resulting research software should be open
and adhere to the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and
repeatable) to allow repeatability, reproducibility, and reuse. Compared to
research data, research software should be both archived for reproducibility
and actively maintained for reusability. The FAIR data principles do not
require openness, but research software should be open source software.
Established open source software licenses provide sufficient licensing options,
such that it should be the rare exception to keep research software closed.
  We review and analyze the current state in this area in order to give
recommendations for making computer science research software FAIR and open. We
observe that research software publishing practices in computer science and in
computational science show significant differences.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1977v1,"Development of Computer Science Disciplines - A Social Network Analysis
  Approach","  In contrast to many other scientific disciplines, computer science considers
conference publications. Conferences have the advantage of providing fast
publication of papers and of bringing researchers together to present and
discuss the paper with peers. Previous work on knowledge mapping focused on the
map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published JCR (Journal
Citation Report). Although this data covers most of important journals, it
lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings. That results in an
imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper
presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from
all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer
science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries
(DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at
journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of
sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of
journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and
citation subgraphs. The paper draws several important conclusions. First,
conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science
knowledge. Second, computer science is becoming more interdisciplinary. Third,
experts are the key success factor for sustainability of journals/conferences.

of formal sciences and also being presented as part of applied sciences,
capable of generating value and supporting decision making. Data Science
considers science and, consequently, the scientific method to promote decision
making through data intelligence. In many cases, the application of the method
(or part of it) is considered in Data Science projects in scientific domain
(social sciences, bioinformatics, geospatial projects) or business domain
(finance, logistic, retail), among others. In this sense, this article
addresses the perspectives of Data Science as a multidisciplinary area,
considering science and the scientific method, and its formal structure which
integrate Statistics, Computer Science, and Business Science, also taking into
account Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing Machine Learning, among others.
The article also deals with the perspective of applied Data Science, since Data
Science is used for generating value through scientific and business projects.
Data Science persona is also discussed in the article, concerning the education
of Data Science professionals and its corresponding profiles, since its
projection changes the field of data in the world.

ensuring computer science students graduate with sufficient PDC exposure has
been uneven.
  This paper discusses the impact of ABET's revised criteria that have required
exposure to PDC to achieve accreditation for computer science programs since
2018. The authors reviewed 20 top ABET-accredited computer science programs and
analyzed how they covered the required PDC components in their curricula. Using
their own institutions as case studies, the authors examine in detail how three
different ABET-accredited computer science programs covered PDC using different

http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01053v1,"Computer simulations in science and engineering - Concepts - Practices -
  Perspectives","  The ubiquitous presence of computer simulations in all kinds of research
areas evidence their role as the new driving force for the advancement of
science and engineering research. Nothing seems to escape the image of success
that computer simulations project onto the research community and the general
public. One simple way to illustrate this consists of asking ourselves how
would contemporary science and engineering look like without the use of
computer simulations. The answer would certainly diverge from the current image
we have of scientific and engineering research.
  As much as computer simulations are successful, they are also methods that
fail in their purpose of inquiring about the world; and as much as researchers
make use of them, computer simulations raise important questions that are at
the heart of contemporary science and engineering practice. In this respect,
computer simulations make a fantastic subject of research for the natural
sciences, the social sciences, engineering and, as in our case, also for
philosophy. Studies on computer simulations touch upon many different facets of
scientific and engineering research and evoke philosophically inclined
questions of interpretation with close ties to problems in experimental
settings and engineering applications (...)

  Science","  Motivated by an intention to remedy current complications with Dutch
terminology concerning informatics, the term informaticology is positioned to
denote an academic counterpart of informatics where informatics is conceived of
as a container for a coherent family of practical disciplines ranging from
computer engineering and software engineering to network technology, data
center management, information technology, and information management in a
broad sense.
  Informaticology escapes from the limitations of instrumental objectives and
the perspective of usage that both restrict the scope of informatics. That is
achieved by including fiction science in informaticology and by ranking fiction
science on equal terms with computer science and data science, and framing (the
study of) game design, evelopment, assessment and distribution, ranging from
serious gaming to entertainment gaming, as a chapter of fiction science. A
suggestion for the scope of fiction science is specified in some detail.
  In order to illustrate the coherence of informaticology thus conceived, a
potential application of fiction to the ontology of instruction sequences and
to software quality assessment is sketched, thereby highlighting a possible
role of fiction (science) within informaticology but outside gaming.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01934v1,"How sustainable is ""common"" data science in terms of power consumption?","  Continuous developments in data science have brought forth an exponential
increase in complexity of machine learning models. Additionally, data
scientists have become ubiquitous in the private market, academic environments
and even as a hobby. All of these trends are on a steady rise, and are
associated with an increase in power consumption and associated carbon
footprint. The increasing carbon footprint of large-scale advanced data science
has already received attention, but the latter trend has not. This work aims to
estimate the contribution of the increasingly popular ""common"" data science to
the global carbon footprint. To this end, the power consumption of several
typical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks will be measured
and compared to: large-scale ""advanced"" data science, common computer-related
tasks, and everyday non-computer related tasks. This is done by converting the
measurements to the equivalent unit of ""km driven by car"". Our main findings
are: ""common"" data science consumes $2.57$ more power than regular computer
usage, but less than some common everyday power-consuming tasks such as
lighting or heating; large-scale data science consumes substantially more power
than common data science.

pathways to stem for students for whom neither mathematics nor computer science
are natural affinities, and who would traditionally be excluded. We discuss a
proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' first
exposure to data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation
and its power. The intent of this approach is to support students, regardless
of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who
are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then
answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. This
discussion is presented in the context of the International Data Science in

  Language Understanding","  Language understanding is a key scientific issue in the fields of cognitive

specific research questions. Cognitive science focuses on analyzing the
specific mechanism of the brain and investigating the brain's response to
language; few studies have examined the brain's language system as a whole. By
contrast, computer scientists focus on the efficiency of practical applications
when choosing research questions but may ignore the most essential laws of
language. Given these differences, can a combination of the disciplines offer
new insights for building intelligent language models and studying language
cognitive mechanisms? In the following text, we first review the research
questions, history, and methods of language understanding in cognitive and
computer science, focusing on the current progress and challenges. We then
compare and contrast the research of language understanding in cognitive and
computer sciences. Finally, we review existing work that combines insights from
language cognition and language computation and offer prospects for future

malicious software (as well as legitimate software and protocols used
maliciously) used to compel a computing device or a network of computing
devices to perform actions desired by the perpetrator of malicious software
(the attacker) and generally contrary to the intent (the policy) of the
legitimate owner or operator (the defender) of the computing device(s). We
further define the science of cyber security as the study of relations --
preferably expressed as theoretically-grounded models -- between attributes,
structures and dynamics of: violations of cyber security policy; the network of
computing devices under attack; the defenders' tools and techniques; and the
attackers' tools and techniques where malicious software plays the central
role. We offer a simple formalism of these key objects within cyber science and
systematically derive a classification of primary problem classes within cyber

Symbolic Computation in Software Science, SCSS 2021.
  Symbolic Computation is the science of computing with symbolic objects
(terms, formulae, programs, representations of algebraic objects, etc.).
Powerful algorithms have been developed during the past decades for the major
subareas of symbolic computation: computer algebra and computational logic.
These algorithms and methods are successfully applied in various fields,
including software science, which covers a broad range of topics about software
construction and analysis.
  Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods and machine learning algorithms
are widely used nowadays in various domains and, in particular, combined with
symbolic computation. Several approaches mix artificial intelligence and
symbolic methods and tools deployed over large corpora to create what is known
as cognitive systems. Cognitive computing focuses on building systems that
interact with humans naturally by reasoning, aiming at learning at scale.
  The purpose of SCSS is to promote research on theoretical and practical
aspects of symbolic computation in software science, combined with modern
artificial intelligence techniques. These proceedings contain the keynote paper
by Bruno Buchberger and ten contributed papers. Besides, the conference program
included three invited talks, nine short and work-in-progress papers, and a
special session on computer algebra and computational logic. Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, the symposium was held completely online. It was organized
by the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC) of the Johannes
Kepler University Linz on September 8--10, 2021.

  Computational Complexity","  There is a cognitive limit in Human Mind. This cognitive limit has played a
decisive role in almost all fields including computer sciences. The cognitive
limit replicated in computer sciences is responsible for inherent Computational
Complexity. The complexity starts decreasing if certain conditions are met,
even sometime it does not appears at all. Very simple Mechanical computing
systems are designed and implemented to demonstrate this idea and it is further
supported by Electrical systems. These verifiable and consistent systems
demonstrate the idea of computational complexity reduction. This work explains
a very important but invisible connection from Mind to Mathematical axioms
(Peano Axioms etc.) and Mathematical axioms to computational complexity. This
study gives a completely new perspective that goes well beyond Cognitive
Science, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Sciences and Philosophy. Based on this
new insight some important predictions are made.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01033v1,Building an Argument for the Use of Science Fiction in HCI Education,"  Science fiction literature, comics, cartoons and, in particular, audio-visual
materials, such as science fiction movies and shows, can be a valuable addition
in Human-computer interaction (HCI) Education. In this paper, we present an
overview of research relative to future directions in HCI Education, distinct
crossings of science fiction in HCI and Computer Science teaching and the
Framework for 21st Century Learning. Next, we provide examples where science
fiction can add to the future of HCI Education. In particular, we argue herein
first that science fiction, as tangible and intangible cultural artifact, can
serve as a trigger for creativity and innovation and thus, support us in
exploring the design space. Second, science fiction, as a means to analyze
yet-to-come HCI technologies, can assist us in developing an open-minded and
reflective dialogue about technological futures, thus creating a singular base
for critical thinking and problem solving. Provided that one is cognizant of
its potential and limitations, we reason that science fiction can be a
meaningful extension of selected aspects of HCI curricula and research.

However, in some cases, if S has certain topological properties, we can
conclude that S is computable. It is known that if a semi-computable set S is a
compact manifold with boundary, then the computability of \deltaS implies the
computability of S. In this paper we examine the case when S is a 1-manifold
with boundary, not necessarily compact. We show that a similar result holds in
this case under assumption that S has finitely many components.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0736v1,Quantum Computation and Quantum Information,"  Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in
computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will
likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,
computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally
stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum
computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum
algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo
techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum
computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to
revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be
generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine
random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up
median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This
paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and
quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and
quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much
faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical
framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4188v2,The skewness of computer science,"  Computer science is a relatively young discipline combining science,
engineering, and mathematics. The main flavors of computer science research
involve the theoretical development of conceptual models for the different
aspects of computing and the more applicative building of software artifacts
and assessment of their properties. In the computer science publication
culture, conferences are an important vehicle to quickly move ideas, and
journals often publish deeper versions of papers already presented at
conferences. These peculiarities of the discipline make computer science an
original research field within the sciences, and, therefore, the assessment of
classical bibliometric laws is particularly important for this field. In this
paper, we study the skewness of the distribution of citations to papers
published in computer science publication venues (journals and conferences). We
find that the skewness in the distribution of mean citedness of different
venues combines with the asymmetry in citedness of articles in each venue,
resulting in a highly asymmetric citation distribution with a power law tail.
Furthermore, the skewness of conference publications is more pronounced than
the asymmetry of journal papers. Finally, the impact of journal papers, as
measured with bibliometric indicators, largely dominates that of proceeding
papers.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05363v1,"How do scientific disciplines evolve in applied sciences? The properties
  of scientific fission and ambidextrous scientific drivers","  One of the fundamental questions in science is how scientific disciplines
evolve and sustain progress in society. No studies to date allows us to explain
the endogenous processes that support the evolution of scientific disciplines
and emergence of new scientific fields in applied sciences of physics. This
study confronts this problem here by investigating the evolution of
experimental physics to explain and generalize some characteristics of the
dynamics of applied sciences. Empirical analysis suggests properties about the
evolution of experimental physics and in general of applied sciences, such as:
a) scientific fission, the evolution of scientific disciplines generates a
process of division into two or more research fields that evolve as autonomous
entities over time; b) ambidextrous drivers of science, the evolution of
science via scientific fission is due to scientific discoveries or new
technologies; c) new driving research fields, the drivers of scientific
disciplines are new research fields rather than old ones; d) science driven by

physics and applied sciences is due to the convergence of experimental and
theoretical branches of physics associated with the development of computer,
information systems and applied computational science. Results also reveal that
average duration of the upwave of scientific production in scientific fields

begins the process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, some
characteristics of the evolutionary dynamics of scientific disciplines that can
lay a foundation for the development of comprehensive properties explaining the

http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12528v2,Data science transfer pathways from associate's to bachelor's programs,"  A substantial fraction of students who complete their college education at a
public university in the United States begin their journey at one of the 935
public two-year colleges. While the number of four-year colleges offering
bachelor's degrees in data science continues to increase, data science
instruction at many two-year colleges lags behind. A major impediment is the
relative paucity of introductory data science courses that serve multiple
student audiences and can easily transfer. In addition, the lack of pre-defined
transfer pathways (or articulation agreements) for data science creates a
growing disconnect that leaves students who want to study data science at a
disadvantage. We describe opportunities and barriers to data science transfer
pathways. Five points of curricular friction merit attention: 1) a first course
in data science, 2) a second course in data science, 3) a course in scientific
computing, data science workflow, and/or reproducible computing, 4) lab
sciences, and 5) navigating communication, ethics, and application domain
requirements in the context of general education and liberal arts course
mappings. We catalog existing transfer pathways, efforts to align curricula
across institutions, obstacles to overcome with minimally-disruptive solutions,
and approaches to foster these pathways. Improvements in these areas are
critically important to ensure that a broad and diverse set of students are
able to engage and succeed in undergraduate data science programs.

have found that to solve well-structured problems in the sciences, students
must first memorize fundamental facts and procedures in mathematics and science
until they can be recalled with automaticity, then practice applying those

life, e.g., through the development of safer, more durable, more economical,
environmentally friendly, and sustainable materials. Visual computing in
materials science integrates computer science disciplines from image
processing, visualization, computer graphics, pattern recognition, computer
vision, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning, to human-computer
interaction, to support the acquisition, analysis, and synthesis of (visual)
materials science data with computer resources. Therefore, visual computing may
provide fundamentally new insights into materials science problems by
facilitating the understanding, discovery, design, and usage of complex
material systems. This seminar is considered as a follow-up of the Dagstuhl
Seminar 19151 Visual Computing in Materials Sciences, held in April 2019. Since
then, the field has kept evolving and many novel challenges have emerged, with
regard to more traditional topics in visual computing, such as topology
analysis or image processing and analysis, to recently emerging topics, such as
uncertainty and ensemble analysis, and to the integration of new research
disciplines and exploratory technologies, such machine learning and immersive
analytics. With the current seminar, we target to strengthen and extend the
collaboration between the domains of visual computing and materials science
(and across visual computing disciplines), by foreseeing challenges and
identifying novel directions of interdisciplinary work. We brought visual
computing and visualization experts from academia, research centers, and
industry together with domain experts, to uncover the overlaps of visual
computing and materials science and to discover yet-unsolved challenges, on
which we can collaborate to achieve a higher societal impact.

computational social choice theory, focuses on one direction of that process by
presenting a brief overview of how most computational complexity theorists view
the world. Although our immediate motivation is to make the lens through which
complexity theorists see the world be better understood by those in the social

for nontheoreticians to understand how theoreticians think, just as it is
equally important within computer science for theoreticians to understand how

http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06606v3,On optimising cost and value in compute systems for radio astronomy,"  Large-scale science instruments, such as the distributed radio telescope
LOFAR, show that we are in an era of data-intensive scientific discovery. Such
instruments rely critically on significant computing resources, both hardware
and software, to do science. Considering limited science budgets, and the small
fraction of these that can be dedicated to compute hardware and software, there
is a strong and obvious desire for low-cost computing. However, optimising for
cost is only part of the equation; the value potential over the lifetime of the
solution should also be taken into account. Using a tangible example, compute
hardware, we introduce a conceptual model to approximate the lifetime relative
science value of such a system. While the introduced model is not intended to
result in a numeric value for merit, it does enumerate some components that
define this metric. The intent of this paper is to show how compute system
related design and procurement decisions in data-intensive science projects
should be weighed and valued. By using both total cost and science value as a
driver, the science output per invested Euro is maximised. With a number of
case studies, focused on computing applications in radio astronomy past,
present and future, we show that the hardware-based analysis can be, and has
been, applied more broadly.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12372v1,Data-driven Computational Social Science: A Survey,"  Social science concerns issues on individuals, relationships, and the whole
society. The complexity of research topics in social science makes it the
amalgamation of multiple disciplines, such as economics, political science, and
sociology, etc. For centuries, scientists have conducted many studies to
understand the mechanisms of the society. However, due to the limitations of
traditional research methods, there exist many critical social issues to be
explored. To solve those issues, computational social science emerges due to
the rapid advancements of computation technologies and the profound studies on
social science. With the aids of the advanced research techniques, various
kinds of data from diverse areas can be acquired nowadays, and they can help us
look into social problems with a new eye. As a result, utilizing various data
to reveal issues derived from computational social science area has attracted
more and more attentions. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we
present a survey on data-driven computational social science for the first time
which primarily focuses on reviewing application domains involving human
dynamics. The state-of-the-art research on human dynamics is reviewed from
three aspects: individuals, relationships, and collectives. Specifically, the
research methodologies used to address research challenges in aforementioned
application domains are summarized. In addition, some important open challenges

http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9911010v1,The Sources of Certainty in Computation and Formal Systems,"  In his Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking
Truth in the Sciences, Rene Descartes sought ``clear and certain knowledge of
all that is useful in life.'' Almost three centuries later, in ``The
foundations of mathematics,'' David Hilbert tried to ``recast mathematical
definitions and inferences in such a way that they are unshakable.'' Hilbert's
program relied explicitly on formal systems (equivalently, computational
systems) to provide certainty in mathematics. The concepts of computation and
formal system were not defined in his time, but Descartes' method may be
understood as seeking certainty in essentially the same way.
  In this article, I explain formal systems as concrete artifacts, and
investigate the way in which they provide a high level of certainty---arguably
the highest level achievable by rational discourse. The rich understanding of
formal systems achieved by mathematical logic and computer science in this
century illuminates the nature of programs, such as Descartes' and Hilbert's,
that seek certainty through rigorous analysis.

Formal Verification (SLFV) have been devised. Typically such approaches exploit
the capability of simulators to save computation time by saving and restoring
the state of the system under simulation. However, even though such approaches
aim to (bounded) formal verification, as a matter of fact, the simulator
behaviour is not formally modelled and the proof of correctness of the proposed
approaches basically relies on the intuitive notion of simulator behaviour.
This gap makes it hard to check if the optimisations introduced to speed up the
simulation do not actually omit checking relevant behaviours of the system
under verification.
  The aim of this paper is to fill the above gap by presenting a formal
semantics for simulators.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04713v1,Reflections on the Evolution of Computer Science Education,"  Computer Science education has been evolving over the years to reflect
applied realities. Until about a decade ago, theory of computation, algorithm
design and system software dominated the curricula. Most courses were
considered core and were hence mandatory; the programme structure did not allow
much of a choice or variety. This column analyses why this changed Circa 2010
when elective subjects across scores of topics become part of mainstream
education to reflect the on-going lateral acceleration of Computer Science.
Fundamental discoveries in artificial intelligence, machine learning,
virtualization and cloud computing are several decades old. Many core theories
in data science are centuries old. Yet their leverage exploded only after Circa
2010, when the stage got set for people-centric problem solving in massive
scale. This was due in part to the rush of innovative real-world applications
that reached the common man through the ubiquitous smart phone. AI/ML modules
arrived in popular programming languages; they could be used to build and train
models on powerful - yet affordable - compute on public clouds reachable
through high-speed Internet connectivity. Academia responded by adapting
Computer Science curricula to align it with the changing technology landscape.
The goal of this experiential piece is to trigger a lively discussion on the
past and future of Computer Science education.

vary with time in which individual agents act in their best interest. In this
paper we provide a survey of a particular dynamic model, the deterministic
queuing model, and discuss how the model can be adjusted and applied to
different real-life scenarios. We then examine how these adjustments affect the
computability, optimality, and existence of selfish routings.

long a subject of philosophical speculation and analysis in its own right.
Quantum computing combines both of these more traditional areas of inquiry into
one wholly new (if not quite independent) science. There are philosophical
questions that arise from this merger, and philosophical lessons to be learned.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01624v1,Implicit Gender Bias in Computer Science -- A Qualitative Study,"  Gender diversity in the tech sector is - not yet? - sufficient to create a
balanced ratio of men and women. For many women, access to computer science is
hampered by socialization-related, social, cultural and structural obstacles.
The so-called implicit gender bias has a great influence in this respect. The
lack of contact in areas of computer science makes it difficult to develop or
expand potential interests. Female role models as well as more transparency of
the job description should help women to promote their - possible - interest in
the job description. However, gender diversity can also be promoted and
fostered through adapted measures by leaders.

search problem in which, given a block number i, we are to find a location of a
target keyword in an ordered list of the i-th block. Apart from much studied
polynomial and adversary methods for quantum query complexity lower bounds, our
argument shows that the multiple-block ordered search needs a large number of
nonadaptive oracle queries on a black-box model of quantum computation that is
also supplemented with advice. Our argument is also applied to the notions of
computational complexity theory: quantum truth-table reducibility and quantum
truth-table autoreducibility.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1607v4,Julia: A Fresh Approach to Numerical Computing,"  Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from
the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a
new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast.
Julia questions notions generally held as ""laws of nature"" by practitioners of
numerical computing:
  1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow.
  2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language
for speed or deployment, and
  3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left
untouched as they are built by the experts.
  We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance
between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom
treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the
right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation
is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are
stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another
technique from computer science, generic programming.
  Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human
convenience.

that computers can solve the most pressing problems of science, and even more
besides. We explore the limits of computational modelling and conclude that, in
the domains of science and engineering that are relatively simple and firmly
grounded in theory, these methods are indeed powerful. Even so, the
availability of code, data and documentation, along with a range of techniques
for validation, verification and uncertainty quantification, are essential for
building trust in computer generated findings. When it comes to complex systems
in domains of science that are less firmly grounded in theory, notably biology
and medicine, to say nothing of the social sciences and humanities, computers
can create the illusion of objectivity, not least because the rise of big data
and machine learning pose new challenges to reproducibility, while lacking true
explanatory power. We also discuss important aspects of the natural world which
cannot be solved by digital means. In the long-term, renewed emphasis on
analogue methods will be necessary to temper the excessive faith currently
placed in digital computation.

computational resources that respond in real-time. However, scholarly
literature shows varying research areas and various interpretations of COC.
This calls for a cohesive architecture that delineates the nature of COC. We
argue that if Herbert Simon considered the design science is the science of
artificial, cognitive systems are the products of cognitive science or 'the
newest science of the artificial'. Therefore, building a conceptual basis for
COC is an essential step into prospective cognitive computing-based systems.
This paper proposes an architecture of COC through analyzing the literature on
COC using a myriad of statistical analysis methods. Then, we compare the
statistical analysis results with previous qualitative analysis results to
confirm our findings. The study also comprehensively surveys the recent
research on COC to identify the state of the art and connect the advances in
varied research disciplines in COC. The study found that there are three
underlaying computing paradigms, Von-Neuman, Neuromorphic Engineering and
Quantum Computing, that comprehensively complement the structure of cognitive
computation. The research discuss possible applications and open research
directions under the COC umbrella.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00135v1,HoneyComb: A Flexible LLM-Based Agent System for Materials Science,"  The emergence of specialized large language models (LLMs) has shown promise
in addressing complex tasks for materials science. Many LLMs, however, often
struggle with distinct complexities of material science tasks, such as
materials science computational tasks, and often rely heavily on outdated
implicit knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address
these challenges, we introduce HoneyComb, the first LLM-based agent system
specifically designed for materials science. HoneyComb leverages a novel,
high-quality materials science knowledge base (MatSciKB) and a sophisticated
tool hub (ToolHub) to enhance its reasoning and computational capabilities
tailored to materials science. MatSciKB is a curated, structured knowledge
collection based on reliable literature, while ToolHub employs an Inductive
Tool Construction method to generate, decompose, and refine API tools for
materials science. Additionally, HoneyComb leverages a retriever module that
adaptively selects the appropriate knowledge source or tools for specific
tasks, thereby ensuring accuracy and relevance. Our results demonstrate that
HoneyComb significantly outperforms baseline models across various tasks in
materials science, effectively bridging the gap between current LLM
capabilities and the specialized needs of this domain. Furthermore, our
adaptable framework can be easily extended to other scientific domains,
highlighting its potential for broad applicability in advancing scientific
research and applications.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05225v1,Popularity of arXiv.org within Computer Science,"  It may seem surprising that, out of all areas of science, computer scientists
have been slow to post electronic versions of papers on sites like arXiv.org.
Instead, computer scientists have tended to place papers on our individual home

  But this is changing. More and more computer scientists are now using the

This discussion is often carried out with precious little evidence of how
popular prepublication is.
  We measure what percentage of papers in computer science are placed on the
arXiv, by cross-referencing published papers in DBLP with e-prints on arXiv. We
found:
  * Usage of arXiv.org has risen dramatically among the most selective

  * Areas of computer science vary widely in e-print prevalence. In theoretical
computer science and machine learning, over 60% of published papers are on
arXiv, while other areas are essentially zero. In most areas, arXiv usage is
rising.
  * Many researchers use arXiv for posting preprints. Of the 2017 published

for modern applications, with quantum computing being among the most prominent
and promising technologies. However, this development creates a gap in current
computer science curricula since most quantum computing lectures are strongly
physics-oriented and have little intersection with the remaining curriculum of
computer science. This fact makes designing an appealing course very difficult,
in particular for non-physicists. Furthermore, in the academic community, there
is consensus that quantum computers are going to be used only for specific
computational tasks (e.g., in computational science), where hybrid systems -
combined classical and quantum computers - facilitate the execution of an
application on both quantum and classical computing resources. A hybrid system
thus executes only certain suitable parts of an application on the quantum
machine, while other parts are executed on the classical components of the
system. To fully exploit the capabilities of hybrid systems and to meet future
requirements in this emerging field, we need to prepare a new generation of
computer scientists with skills in both distributed computing and quantum
computing. To bridge this existing gap in standard computer science curricula,
we designed a new lecture and exercise series on Hybrid Quantum-Classical
Systems, where students learn how to decompose applications and implement
computational tasks on a hybrid quantum-classical computational continuum.
While learning the inherent concepts underlying quantum systems, students are
obligated to apply techniques and methods they are already familiar with,

Consortium, using its detailed enrollment and course statistics for the past
four to five years. Not only do these data display a steady and rapid increase
in the demand for research-computing instruction, they also show a clear shift
from traditional (high performance) computing to data-oriented methods. It is
argued that this growing demand warrants specialized research computing
degrees. The possible curricula of such degrees are described next, taking
existing programs as an example, and adding SciNet's experiences of student
desires as well as trends in advanced research computing.

avenues for mining Big-Data of materials science. Novel data-analytics concepts
and tools turn data into knowledge and help the prediction of new materials or
the identification of new properties of already known materials.

body pose from single camera photographs or videos. This promises to enable
movement science to detect disease, quantify movement performance, and take the
science out of the lab into the real world. However, current pose tracking
algorithms fall short of the needs of movement science; the types of movement
data that matter are poorly estimated. For instance, the metrics currently used
for evaluating pose tracking algorithms use noisy hand-labeled ground truth
data and do not prioritize precision of relevant variables like
three-dimensional position, velocity, acceleration, and forces which are
crucial for movement science. Here, we introduce the scientific disciplines
that use movement data, the types of data they need, and discuss the changes
needed to make pose tracking truly transformative for movement science.

supporting abstraction, enabled by weak probabilistic bisimulation serving as
the reference notion for summarising the effect of abstraction. This paper
considers probabilistic automata augmented with costs. It extends the notions
of weak transitions in probabilistic automata in such a way that the costs
incurred along a weak transition are captured. This gives rise to
cost-preserving and cost-bounding variations of weak probabilistic
bisimilarity, for which we establish compositionality properties with respect
to parallel composition. Furthermore, polynomial-time decision algorithms are
proposed, that can be effectively used to compute reward-bounding abstractions
of Markov decision processes in a compositional manner.

theory of join semilattices); this solves a somewhat long-standing open
problem, and contrasts with recent results that had ruled out previously
expected counterexamples. On the other hand, we show that tensors with bounded

http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2522v2,Science 3.0: Corrections to the Science 2.0 paradigm,"  The concept of Science 2.0 was introduced almost a decade ago to describe the
new generation of online-based tools for researchers allowing easier data
sharing, collaboration and publishing. Although technically sound, the concept
still does not work as expected. Here we provide a systematic line of arguments
to modify the concept of Science 2.0, making it more consistent with the spirit
and traditions of science and Internet. Our first correction to the Science 2.0
paradigm concerns the open-access publication models charging fees to the
authors. As discussed elsewhere, we show that the monopoly of such publishing
models increases biases and inequalities in the representation of scientific
ideas based on the author's income. Our second correction concerns
post-publication comments online, which are all essentially non-anonymous in
the current Science 2.0 paradigm. We conclude that scientific post-publication
discussions require special anonymization systems. We further analyze the
reasons of the failure of the current post-publication peer-review models and
suggest what needs to be changed in Science 3.0 to convert Internet into a
large journal club.

their publications, but would this be mistaken in some fields? Whilst poetic
titles are known to be common in medicine, it is not clear whether the practice
is widespread elsewhere. This article investigates the prevalence of poetic
expressions in journal article titles 1996-2019 in 3.3 million articles from
all 27 Scopus broad fields. Expressions were identified by manually checking
all phrases with at least 5 words that occurred at least 25 times, finding 149
stock phrases, idioms, sayings, literary allusions, film names and song titles
or lyrics. The expressions found are most common in the social sciences and the
humanities. They are also relatively common in medicine, but almost absent from
engineering and the natural and formal sciences. The differences may reflect
the less hierarchical and more varied nature of the social sciences and
humanities, where interesting titles may attract an audience. In engineering,
natural science and formal science fields, authors should take extra care with
poetic expressions, in case their choice is judged inappropriate. This includes
interdisciplinary research overlapping these areas. Conversely, reviewers of
interdisciplinary research involving the social sciences should be more
tolerant of poetic license.

resulted in an explosion of user-generated content (UGC), which now extends to
scientific data. Citizen science, in which ordinary people contribute
information for scientific research, epitomizes UGC. Citizen science projects
are typically open to everyone, engage diverse audiences, and challenge
ordinary people to produce data of highest quality to be usable in science.
This also makes citizen science a very exciting area to study both traditional
and innovative approaches to information quality management. With this paper we
position citizen science as a leading information quality research frontier. We
also show how citizen science opens a unique opportunity for the information
systems community to contribute to a broad range of disciplines in natural and

ratings of economic agents as their coordinates in the economic domain.
Economic activity of agents, economic or other factors change agents risk
ratings and that cause motion of agents in the economic domain. Aggregations of
variables and transactions of individual agents in small volume of economic
domain establish the continuous economic media approximation that describes
collective variables, transactions and their flows in the economic domain as
functions of risk coordinates. Any economic variable A(t,x) defines mean risk
XA(t) as risk weighted by economic variable A(t,x). Collective flows of
economic variables in bounded economic domain fluctuate from secure to risky
area and back. These fluctuations of flows cause time oscillations of
macroeconomic variables A(t) and their mean risks XA(t) in economic domain and
are the origin of any business and credit cycles. We derive equations that
describe evolution of collective variables, transactions and their flows in the
economic domain. As illustration we present simple self-consistent equations of

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11750v1,The Economic Costs of Containing a Pandemic,"  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused one of the most serious social
and economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza
pandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as
well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in
a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local
governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate
suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between
economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public
interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major
problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts
certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such
economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,
there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,
which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul
Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or
otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future
generations.

growth theories identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the
relative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional
variables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions.
The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate
measures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and
structural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their
capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in
explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ
economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex
network techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more
traditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth
theories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement
with other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in
fostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be
either complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely
overshadow them.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03564v1,Potterian Economics,"  Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience offer systematic evidence that
fictional works exert a surprisingly strong influence on readers and have the
power to shape their opinions and worldviews. Building on these findings, we
study what we term Potterian economics, the economic ideas, insights, and
structure, found in Harry Potter books, to assess how the books might affect
economic literacy. A conservative estimate suggests that more than 7.3 percent
of the world population has read the Harry Potter books, and millions more have
seen their movie adaptations. These extraordinary figures underscore the
importance of the messages the books convey. We explore the Potterian economic
model and compare it to professional economic models to assess the consistency
of the Potterian economic principles with the existing economic models. We find
that some of the principles of Potterian economics are consistent with
economists models. Many other principles, however, are distorted and contain
numerous inaccuracies, contradicting professional economists views and
insights. We conclude that Potterian economics can teach us about the formation
and dissemination of folk economics, the intuitive notions of naive individuals
who see market transactions as a zero-sum game, who care about distribution but
fail to understand incentives and efficiency, and who think of prices as
allocating wealth but not resources or their efficient use.

Through the creative-destructive process, entrepreneurs are often able to
innovate and outperform incumbent organizations, all of which is supposed to

Specifically, entrepreneurship does not lead to growth in developing countries;
it only does in more developed countries with higher income levels. Using

Our evidence validates earlier studies findings but also exposes previously
undiscovered findings. That is, we find that entrepreneurship encourages
economic growth but not in developing countries. In addition, our evidence
finds that the institutional environment of the country, as measured by GEM
Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions, only contributes to economic growth in
more developed countries but not in developing countries. These findings have
important policy implications. Namely, our evidence contradicts policy
proposals that suggest entrepreneurship and the adoption of pro-market
institutions that support it to encourage economic growth in developing
countries. Our evidence suggests these policy proposals will be unlikely to
generate the economic growth desired.

approach to measure the economic uncertainties by using the Hidden Markov Model

firms in Shanghai from 2018 to 2020 to construct the ECU indexes. Results show
that all ECU indexes, whether at sectoral or regional level, successfully
captured the negative impacts of COVID-19 on Shanghai's economic conditions.
Besides, the ECU indexes also presented the heterogeneities in different
districts as well as in different sectors. This reflects the facts that changes
in the uncertainty of economic conditions are mainly related to regional
economic structures and targeted regulatory policies faced by sectors. The ECU
index can also be readily extended to measure the uncertainty of economic
conditions in various realms, which has great potentials in the future.

In this paper, we use Newton's theory of motion as the basis for the theory of

We follow Newton's original development, as set forth in the Principia, to
determine economic analogs to his three laws of motion. The pivotal result is
an operational definition for an economic force, i.e. a want or a desire, in
terms of a price adjustment. With this, we model the price effects of scarcity
and trade friction in analogy with the models for the spring and damping force.
In turn, we define economic benefits and surplus as analogous to the
definitions of mechanical work and energy. These are then used to interpret the
various types of economic equilibrium considered by economists from a
mechanical perspective. The effectiveness of the analogy is illustrated by
applying it to modelling the price and inventory dynamics of various economic
agents -- including consumers, dealers, holders, spot and futures traders --
using linear-time invariant systems theory.

population clusters forming around economic hubs and the development of wealth
concentration in certain areas. These patterns highlight the mutual
reinforcement between population density and economic factors. The study
provides insights into the dynamics of urban growth, economic disparities, and
resource distribution, offering a simplified yet powerful lens through which to

http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04721v1,Econophysics Beyond General Equilibrium: the Business Cycle Model,"  Current business cycle theory is an application of the general equilibrium
theory. This paper presents the business cycle model without using general
equilibrium framework. We treat agents risk assessments as their coordinates x
on economic space and establish distribution of all economic agents by their
risk coordinates. We suggest aggregation of agents and their variables by
scales large to compare with risk scales of single agents and small to compare
with economic domain on economic space. Such model is alike to transition from
kinetic description of multi-particle system to hydrodynamic approximation.
Aggregates of agents extensive variables with risk coordinate x determine macro
variables as functions of x alike to hydrodynamic variables. Economic and
financial transactions between agents define evolution of their variables.
Aggregation of transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y
determine macro transactions as functions of x and y and define evolution of
macro variables at points x and y. We describe evolution and interactions
between macro transactions by hydrodynamic-like system of economic equations.
We show that business cycles are described as consequence of the system of
economic equations on macro transactions. As example we describe Credit
transactions CL(tax,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to
Borrowers at point y and Loan-Repayment transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe
repayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x. We use
hydrodynamic-like economic equations and derive from them the system of
ordinary differential equations that describe business cycle fluctuations of
macro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics. The
nature of business cycle fluctuations is explained as oscillations of ""mean

we examine a novel dataset containing the economic content of 951 speeches

significant interconnections within a network obtained from the economic
content of presidential speeches. In such a network, nodes are represented by
talks and links by values of cosine similarity, the latter computed using the
occurrences of the economic terms in the speeches. The resulting network
displays a peculiar structure made up of a core (i.e. a set of highly central

sparsely connected nodes). The presence of different economic dictionaries
employed by the Presidents characterize the core-periphery structure. The
Presidents' talks belonging to the network's core share the usage of generic
(non-technical) economic locutions like ""interest"" or ""trade"". While the use of
more technical and less frequent terms characterizes the periphery (e.g.

role narratives play in the economy. Even though empirical approaches that try
to quantify economic narratives are getting increasingly popular, there is no

underlying this research. First, we review and categorize the economic
literature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that
are at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active
drivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative
economics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating
five important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be
economically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social
context and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a
collective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of
narratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to
the popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the
complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language
processing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go
beyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative
economics.

majors. In the experiments, participants face a tradeoff between profit
maximization, that is the market norm and workers welfare, that is the social
norm. We use priming to manipulate the cues that the participants receive
before they make their decision. We find that when participants receive cues
signaling that the decision has an economic context, both economics and
non-economics students tend to maximize profits. When the participants receive
cues emphasizing social norms, on the other hand, both economics and
non-economics students are less likely to maximize profits. We conclude that
some of the differences found between the decisions of economics and

ECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare
different measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with
monetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the
non-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have
stronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate
regressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other

Among many other cases, human height and demographics, economic growth,
earnings and wages, and crop production are generally recorded as continuous
measures, and are collected and studied by economic historians. In this paper
we describe and discuss the broad utility of quantile regression for use in
research in economic history, review recent quantitive literature in the field,
and provide an illustrative example of the use of these methods based on 20,000
records of human height measured across 50-plus years in the 19th and 20th

interval {\Delta}. We call them first-order economic variables. We describe how
the volatilities and correlations of market trade values and volumes determine
price volatility. We argue that such a link requests consideration of agents'
economic variables of the second order that are composed of sums of squares of
agents' transactions during {\Delta}. Almost any variable of the first order
should be complemented by its second-order pair. Respectively, the sums of
agents' second-order variables introduce macroeconomic variables of the second
order. The description of the first- and second-order macroeconomic variables
establishes the subject of second-order economic theory. We highlight that the
complexity of second-order economic theory essentially restricts any hopes for
precise predictions of price probability and, at best, could provide estimates
of price volatility. That limits the predictions of price probability to
Gauss's approximations only.

believed that economic activities play an important role. More specifically,
asset prices are more sensitive to the systematic economic news that impose a
pervasive effect on the whole market. Moreover, the investors will not be

the paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an

new factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they
examined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The
paper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic
news, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the
significant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by
such motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general
framework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic
factors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.

we exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring,
framing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as
such biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs)
are trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases?
Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support
human decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of
modern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs.
Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior
against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To
demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a
variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of
current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We
also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic
behavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure
the effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases.

  modeling approach","  Economic inequality is one of the pivotal issues for most of economic and
social policy makers across the world to insure the sustainable economic growth
and justice. In the mainstream school of economics, namely neoclassical
theories, economic issues are dealt with in a mechanistic manner. Such a
mainstream framework is majorly focused on investigating a socio-economic
system based on an axiomatic scheme where reductionism approach plays a vital
role. The major limitations of such theories include unbounded rationality of
economic agents, reducing the economic aggregates to a set of predictable
factors and lack of attention to adaptability and the evolutionary nature of
economic agents. In tackling deficiencies of conventional economic models, in
the past two decades, some new approaches have been recruited. One of those
novel approaches is the Complex adaptive systems (CAS) framework which has
shown a very promising performance in action. In contrast to mainstream school,
under this framework, the economic phenomena are studied in an organic manner
where the economic agents are supposed to be both boundedly rational and

agents of a system decide and interact. As a powerful way of modeling CASs,
Agent-based models (ABMs) has found a growing application among academicians
and practitioners. ABMs show that how simple behavioral rules of agents and
local interactions among them at micro-scale can generate surprisingly complex
patterns at macro-scale. In this paper, ABMs have been used to show (1) how an
economic inequality emerges in a system and to explain (2) how sadaqah as an

http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0390v1,Staring at Economic Aggregators through Information Lenses,"  It is hard to exaggerate the role of economic aggregators -- functions that
summarize numerous and / or heterogeneous data -- in economic models since the
early XX$^{th}$ century. In many cases, as witnessed by the pioneering works of
Cobb and Douglas, these functions were information quantities tailored to
economic theories, i.e. they were built to fit economic phenomena. In this
paper, we look at these functions from the complementary side: information. We
use a recent toolbox built on top of a vast class of distortions coined by
Bregman, whose application field rivals metrics' in various subfields of
mathematics. This toolbox makes it possible to find the quality of an
aggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc.), from the
standpoint of the information it carries. We prove a rather striking result.
  From the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong
to the \textit{optimal} set. As common economic assumptions enter the analysis,
this large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up \textit{exactly fitting}
either CES, or Cobb-Douglas, or both. To summarize, in the relevant economic
contexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the
information standpoint. We also discuss global economic behaviors of optimal
information aggregators in general, and present a brief panorama of the links
between economic and information aggregators.

  Fragility? Evidence from China","  The prevalent view in the economics literature is that a high level of
infrastructure investment is a precursor to economic growth. China is
especially held up as a model to emulate. Based on the largest dataset of its
kind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates
economic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery.
Far from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure
investment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's
track record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich
democracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive
projects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in
financial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We
conclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation
of surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless
China shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the
country is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic
crisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy.
China's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other
countries but one to avoid.

  Information for Interpretation","  While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied to choice
analysis showing high predictive power, it is unclear to what extent
researchers can interpret economic information from DNNs. This paper
demonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as
classical discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information includes
choice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns
of alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities,
marginal rates of substitution (MRS), and heterogeneous values of time (VOT).
Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn the utility function and reveal
behavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts. However, the
economic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable because of the three
challenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to
hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. To
demonstrate the strength and challenges of DNNs, we estimated the DNNs using a
stated preference survey, extracted the full list of economic information from
the DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the
economic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more
reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or
trainings, and that even simple hyperparameter searching can significantly
improve the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs.
Future studies should investigate other regularizations and DNN architectures,
better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address
DNNs' three challenges, to provide more reliable economic information from
DNN-based choice models.

  Reinforcement Learning","  AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have improved many areas, but are not yet
widely adopted in economic policy design, mechanism design, or economics at
large. At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of
counterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to
experiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that
machine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism
design framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a
two-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who
co-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel
two-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn
rational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal
taxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal
tax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist
substantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off
between equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent
tax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral
change more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the
first time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a
complement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational

complexity related to the diverse structure, functionality, spatiality, and
dynamics describing economic systems. Towards serving the demand of
integration, this paper develops a three-dimensional index, capturing
engineering, ecological, and evolutionary aspects of economic resilience that
are considered separately in the current literature. The proposed index is
computed on GDP data of worldwide countries, for the period 1960-2020,
concerning 14 crises considered as shocks, and was found well defined in a
conceptual context of its components. Its application on real-world data allows
introducing a novel classification of countries in terms of economic
resilience, and reveals geographical patterns and structural determinants of
this attribute. Impressively enough, economic resilience appears positively
related to major productivity coefficients, gravitationally driven, and
depended on agricultural specialization, with high structural heterogeneity in
the low class. Also, the analysis fills the literature gap by shaping the
worldwide map of economic resilience, revealing geographical duality and
centrifugal patterns in its geographical distribution, a relationship between
diachronically good performance in economic resilience and geographical
distance from the shocks origin, and a continent differentiation expressed by
the specialization of America in engineering resilience, Africa and Asia in
ecological and evolutionary resilience, and a relative lag of Europe and
Oceania. Finally, the analysis provides insights into the effect of the 2008 on

This hypothesis is compelling because it explains economic change through
endogenous mechanisms, but it has not been quantitatively tested at the global

economic data covering 77 countries to test whether the collective dynamics of
national economic activities can be characterised by eco-evolutionary

which the dynamics of economic activities are coupled with positive and
negative interactions between the activities, the spatial dispersal of the
activities, and their transformations into other economic activities. We find
strong support for the models capturing positive interactions between economic
activities and spatial dispersal of the activities across countries. These
results suggest that processes akin to those occurring in ecosystems play a
significant role in the dynamics of economic systems. The strength-of-evidence
obtained for each model varies across countries and may be caused by
differences in the distance between countries, specific institutional contexts,

Nevertheless, tradition dictates that an enigmatic 'invisible hand' governs
economic valuation. Physical scientists have long proposed alternative but
testable energy cost theories of economic valuation, and have shown the gross
correlation between energy consumption and economic output at the national
level through input-output energy analysis. However, due to the difficulty of
precise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive
evidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual
commodities has yet been found. Over the past century, the US metal market has
accumulated a huge body of price data, which for the first time ever provides
us the opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct energy-value
correlation. Here, by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical
elements (mainly metals) relative to the total energy consumption for refining
them from naturally occurring geochemical conditions, we found a clear
correlation between the energy cost and their market prices. The underlying
physics we proposed has compatibility with conventional economic concepts such
as the ratio between supply and demand or scarcity's role in economic
valuation. It demonstrates how energy cost serves as the 'invisible hand'

Africa. We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic
growth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection

economic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted
regressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and

collected from the World Bank for the period running from 2000 to 2018, and the
nighttime lights data from the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) in

From the models fitted and the reported BIC, AIC, and likelihood ratios, the
insurance sector proved to have more predictive power on economic development
in South Africa, and radiance light explained economic growth better than GDP
and GDP/Capita. We concluded that nighttime data is a good proxy for economic
growth than GDP/Capita in emerging economies like South Africa, where secondary
data needs to be more robust and sometimes inflated. The findings will guide
researchers and policymakers on what drives economic development and what
policies to put in place. It would be interesting to extend the current study

reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning (DL) for handling sophisticated
dynamic business environments offers vast opportunities. DRL is characterized
by scalability with the potential to be applied to high-dimensional problems in
conjunction with noisy and nonlinear patterns of economic data. In this work,
we first consider a brief review of DL, RL, and deep RL methods in diverse
applications in economics providing an in-depth insight into the state of the
art. Furthermore, the architecture of DRL applied to economic applications is
investigated in order to highlight the complexity, robustness, accuracy,
performance, computational tasks, risk constraints, and profitability. The
survey results indicate that DRL can provide better performance and higher
accuracy as compared to the traditional algorithms while facing real economic
problems at the presence of risk parameters and the ever-increasing
uncertainties.

  European carbon market","  The European Union Emission Trading Scheme is a carbon emission allowance
trading system designed by Europe to achieve emission reduction targets. The
amount of carbon emission caused by production activities is closely related to
the socio-economic environment. Therefore, from the perspective of economic
policy uncertainty, this article constructs the GARCH-MIDAS-EUEPU and
GARCH-MIDAS-GEPU models for investigating the impact of European and global
economic policy uncertainty on carbon price fluctuations. The results show that
both European and global economic policy uncertainty will exacerbate the
long-term volatility of European carbon spot return, with the latter having a
stronger impact when the change is the same. Moreover, the volatility of the
European carbon spot return can be forecasted better by the predictor, global
economic policy uncertainty. This research can provide some implications for
market managers in grasping carbon market trends and helping participants
control the risk of fluctuations in carbon allowances.

institutional specificities, since unemployment was the main channel through
which the economic and financial crisis influenced the social developments.. In
this context, I performed two institutional clusters depending on their

the crisis effect on unemployment rate over the 2003-2017 period. Both models
were estimated by using Panel Estimated Generalized Least Squares method, and
are weighted by Period SUR option in order to remove, in advance the possible

criterion that drives the impact of economic and financial crises on the
unemployment rate, highlighting that countries with inclusive institutions are
less vulnerable to economic shocks and are more resilient than countries with
extractive institutions. The quality of institutions was also found to have a
significant effect on the response of unemployment rate to the dynamic of its

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06894v2,"Do economic effects of the anti-COVID-19 lockdowns in different regions
  interact through supply chains?","  To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many cities, states, and countries have
`locked down', restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such
lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study
examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact
through supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an
agent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in
Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the
interactions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by
decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We
find that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier
substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the
economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region
lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on
whether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked
through supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy
coordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.

development in terms of its production and export of goods, is interwoven with
the urbanization process during the early stages of its economic development

economic growth and urbanization fades away with respect to its later stages,
becoming negligible for countries highly dependent on the export of resources
where urbanization is not linked to any structural economic transformation.

This demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level production networks to

countries, cities, and regions, economic complexity has been found applicable
in diverse contexts such as ecology and chess openings. The success of economic
complexity stems from its capacity to assess hidden capabilities within a
system indirectly. The existing algorithms for economic complexity operate only
when the underlying interaction topology conforms to a bipartite graph. A
single link disrupting the bipartite structure renders these algorithms
inapplicable, even if the weight of that link is tiny compared to others. This
paper presents a novel extension of economic complexity to encompass any graph,
overcoming the constraints of bipartite structures. Additionally, it introduces
fitness centrality and orthofitness centrality as new centrality measures in
graphs. Fitness Centrality emerges as a promising metric for assessing node
vulnerability, akin to node betweenness centrality. Furthermore, we unveil the
cost functions that drive the minimization procedures underlying the economic
complexity index and fitness centrality algorithms. This extension broadens the
scope of economic complexity analysis, enabling its application in diverse
network structures beyond bipartite graphs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11913v1,Big data in economics,"  The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around
2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information
assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need
special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form
them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology
field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental
decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,
engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,
social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide
enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic
research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure
the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,
population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic
phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will
start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources
can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast
and with reduced costs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01212v1,EconNLI: Evaluating Large Language Models on Economics Reasoning,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for writing economic analysis
reports or providing financial advice, but their ability to understand economic
knowledge and reason about potential results of specific economic events lacks
systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we propose a new dataset, natural
language inference on economic events (EconNLI), to evaluate LLMs' knowledge
and reasoning abilities in the economic domain. We evaluate LLMs on (1) their
ability to correctly classify whether a premise event will cause a hypothesis
event and (2) their ability to generate reasonable events resulting from a
given premise. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are not sophisticated in
economic reasoning and may generate wrong or hallucinated answers. Our study
raises awareness of the limitations of using LLMs for critical decision-making
involving economic reasoning and analysis. The dataset and codes are available

http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01830v1,Reinterpreting economic complexity in multiple dimensions,"  We build on the interpretation of the Economic Complexity method as
Correspondence Analysis (CA), and propose that the Canonical form of CA (CCA),
which originated in the ecology literature, can be used to calculate
multi-dimensional economic complexity. The traditional (CA) way of calculating
economic complexity includes no ""external"" information such as countries'
development characteristics to facilitate interpretation of ""complexity"". This
has led to a wide range of fairly ad hoc interpretations of economic complexity
on the basis of ex-post correlation to a long list of other variables. By the
ex-ante inclusion of a number of country variables in the construction of the
complexity indicators, CCA enables better interpretation, also in the case of
multi-dimensional indicators. The analysis is further facilitated by another
element of the ecologists' toolbox, the so-called biplots, which are CCA-based
graph embeddings that represent a lower-dimensional product-space in which
products and countries are positioned together, in mutual correspondence to
each other. We show that in this way, CCA provides a richer account of
development in many of its aspects, especially economic growth.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11843v1,An Interacting Agent Model of Economic Crisis,"  Most national economies are linked by international trade. Consequently,
economic globalization forms a massive and complex economic network with strong
links, that is, interactions arising from increasing trade. Various interesting
collective motions are expected to emerge from strong economic interactions in
a global economy under trade liberalization. Among the various economic
collective motions, economic crises are our most intriguing problem. In our
previous studies, we have revealed that the Kuramoto's coupled limit-cycle
oscillator model and the Ising-like spin model on networks are invaluable tools
for characterizing the economic crises. In this study, we develop a
mathematical theory to describe an interacting agent model that derives the
Kuramoto model and the Ising-like spin model by using appropriate
approximations. Our interacting agent model suggests phase synchronization and
spin ordering during economic crises. We confirm the emergence of the phase
synchronization and spin ordering during economic crises by analyzing various
economic time series data. We also develop a network reconstruction model based
on entropy maximization that considers the sparsity of the network. Here
network reconstruction means estimating a network's adjacency matrix from a
node's local information. The interbank network is reconstructed using the
developed model, and a comparison is made of the reconstructed network with the
actual data. We successfully reproduce the interbank network and the known
stylized facts. In addition, the exogenous shock acting on an industry
community in a supply chain network and financial sector are estimated.
Estimation of exogenous shocks acting on communities of in the real economy in
the supply chain network provide evidence of the channels of distress
propagating from the financial sector to the real economy through the supply
chain network.

together occupy an optimal distribution of income. Despite this, the
spontaneous order might degenerate in the form of economic crises whenever an

theoretical framework of spontaneous order provides a bridge linking Austrian
economics and Neoclassical economics, where we shall comprehend a truth:

the nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of
economical growth is solved as a variational problem with a velocity dependent

structure switching and argues how a country develops its economy by endogenous
structural transformation and efficient resource allocation in a market
mechanism. To achieve this goal, the paper first summarizes three attributes of
economic structures from the literature, namely, structurality, durationality,
and transformality, and discuss their implications for methods of economic
modeling. Then, with the common knowledge assumption, the paper extends Xing's
(2023a) optimal growth model that is based on production function switching and
considers an extended Ramsey model with endogenous structural transformation in
which the social planner chooses the optimal industrial structure, recource
allocation with the chosen structure, and consumption to maximize the
representative household's total utility subject to the resource constraint.
The paper next establishes the mathematical underpinning of the static,
dynamic, and switching equilibria. The Ramsey growth model and its equilibria
are then extended to economies with complicated economic structures consisting
of hierarchical production, technology adoption and innovation, infrastructure,
and economic and political institutions. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion of applications of the proposed methodology to economic development
problems in other scenarios.

2.1% of global economic production for a 3$^\circ$C rise in global average
surface temperature, and 7.9% for a 6$^\circ$C rise. Such relatively trivial
estimates of economic damages -- when these economists otherwise assume that
human economic productivity will be an order of magnitude higher than today --
contrast strongly with predictions made by scientists of significantly reduced
human habitability from climate change. Nonetheless, the coupled economic and
climate models used to make such predictions have been influential in the
international climate change debate and policy prescriptions. Here we review
the empirical work done by economists and show that it severely underestimates
damages from climate change by committing several methodological errors,
including neglecting tipping points, and assuming that economic sectors not
exposed to the weather are insulated from climate change. Most fundamentally,
the influential Integrated Assessment Model DICE is shown to be incapable of
generating an economic collapse, regardless of the level of damages. Given
these flaws, economists' empirical estimates of economic damages from global
warming should be rejected as unscientific, and models that have been
calibrated to them, such as DICE, should not be used to evaluate economic risks
from climate change, or in the development of policy to attenuate damages.

towards more collaborative, strategic flight planning. This opens up the
possibility for inclusion of additional information in the collaborative

economic risk of network elements (e.g., sectors or airports) as the expected
costs that the elements impose on airspace users due to Air Traffic Flow
Management (ATFM) regulations. The definition of the indicator is based on the
analysis of historical ATFM regulations data, that provides an indication of
the risk of accruing delay. This risk of delay is translated into a monetary
risk for the airspace users, creating the new metric of the economic risk of a
given airspace element. We then use some machine learning techniques to find
the parameters leading to this economic risk. The metric is accompanied by an
indication of the accuracy of the delay cost prediction model. Lastly, the
economic risk is transformed into a qualitative economic severity
classification. The economic risks and consequently economic severity can be
estimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an
indicator which can be used by Air Navigation Service Providers to identify
areas which might need the implementation of strategic measures (e.g.,
resectorisation or capacity provision change), and by Airspace Users to
consider operation of routes which use specific airspace regions.

locations that enable the meeting of people with different socio-economic
status are key for urban inclusion. In this study, we adopt the concept of
economic complexity to quantify the sophistication of amenity supply at urban
locations. We propose that neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity are
connected to the ability of locations to attract diverse visitors from various
socio-economic backgrounds across the city. We construct the measures of
amenity complexity based on the local portfolio of diverse and non-ubiquitous
amenities in Budapest, Hungary. Socio-economic mixing at visited third places
is investigated by tracing the daily mobility of individuals and by
characterizing their status by the real-estate price of their home locations.
Results suggest that measures of ubiquity and diversity of amenities do not,
but neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity are correlated with the
urban centrality of locations. Urban centrality is a strong predictor of
socio-economic mixing, but both neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity
add further explanatory power to our models. Our work combines urban mobility
data with economic complexity thinking to show that the diversity of
non-ubiquitous amenities, central locations, and the potentials for
socio-economic mixing are interrelated.

human decision-making and test diverse theories and hypotheses; however,
substantial costs and efforts are incurred to gather many individuals as
experimental participants. To address this, with the development of large
language models (LLMs), some researchers have recently attempted to develop
simulated economic experiments using LLMs-driven agents, called generative
agents. If generative agents can replicate human-like decision-making in
economic experiments, the cost problem of economic experiments can be
alleviated. However, such a simulation framework has not been yet established.
Considering the previous research and the current evolutionary stage of LLMs,
this study focuses on the reasoning ability of generative agents as a key
factor toward establishing a framework for such a new methodology. A
multi-agent simulation, designed to improve the reasoning ability of generative
agents through prompting methods, was developed to reproduce the result of an
actual economic experiment on the ultimatum game. The results demonstrated that
the higher the reasoning ability of the agents, the closer the results were to
the theoretical solution than to the real experimental result. The results also
suggest that setting the personas of the generative agents may be important for
reproducing the results of real economic experiments. These findings are
valuable for the future definition of a framework for replacing human
participants with generative agents in economic experiments when LLMs are
further developed.

interpretation of these indicators proved difficult. Although the original
Method of Reflections suggested a direct interconnection between country and
product metrics, it has been proved that the Economic and Product Complexity
Indices result from a spectral clustering algorithm that separately groups
similar countries or similar products, respectively. This recent approach to
economic and product complexity conflicts with the original one and treats
separately countries and products. However, building on previous
interpretations of the indices and the recent evolution in spectral clustering,
we show that these indices simultaneously identify two co-clusters of similar
countries and products. This viewpoint reconciles the spectral clustering
interpretation of the indices with the original Method of Reflections
interpretation. By proving the often neglected intimate relationship between
country and product complexity, this approach emphasizes the role of a selected
set of products in determining economic development while extending the range
of applications of these indicators in economics.

economic growth and development up until 2014. Since then, Chile has also been
trapped in a decade of slow economic growth. Chile's sudden slowdown and recent
growth path divergence have posed a puzzle for economic growth and development
economics. This paper examines this slowdown from an empirical perspective and
determines how much can be attributed to internal and external causes. Using a
synthetic control approach and a structural time series Bayesian estimation,
our findings suggest that at least two-thirds of the Chilean slowdown is
attributable to internal causes driven by a policy regime change in 2014, with
external factors playing a secondary role. The net effect of this set of
internal reforms resulted in a nearly 10% reduction in real GDP per capita over
five years and led to a 1.8% decline in average GDP growth rates from 2015 to
2019. Our results are consistent with the literature that establishes that
external shocks can explain only a small fraction of the poor economic
performance of developing countries, suggesting that internal factors are the
primary source of subpar performance. This research sheds light on the
potential effects of policy regime shifts in economic growth, thus providing

intention to vote against the Incumbent even if the Incumbent is from their
self-identified political party. Conversely, having a negative perception of
the national economy (sociotropic voting) is less likely to revoke party
loyalty in the upcoming General election. In simpler terms, voters are more
likely to vote along party lines even if they perceive their party (the

off-equilibrium statistical physics to a system of particles, representing the
economic agents, modelled according to the theoretical foundation of the
current banking regulation, the so called Merton-Vasicek model. Economic agents
are attracted to each other to exchange `economic energy', forming a network of
trades. When the capital level of one economic agent drops below a minimum, the
economic agent becomes insolvent. The insolvency of one single economic agent
affects the economic energy of all its neighbours which thus become susceptible
to insolvency, being able to trigger a chain of insolvencies (avalanche). We
show that the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power-law whose
exponent depends on the minimum capital level. Furthermore, we present evidence
that under an increase in the minimum capital level, large crashes will be
avoided only if one assumes that agents will accept a drop in business levels,
while keeping their trading attitudes and policies unchanged. The alternative
assumption, that agents will try to restore their business levels, may lead to
the unexpected consequence that large crises occur with higher probability.

reconcile it with data and to avoid creating the unwarranted sense of security

http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05012v6,A Simple Measure of Economic Complexity,"  Contrary to conventional economic growth theory, which reduces a country's
output to one aggregate variable (GDP), product diversity is central to
economic development, as recent 'economic complexity' research suggests. A
country's product diversity reflects its diversity of knowhow or
'capabilities'. Researchers proposed the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and
the country Fitness index to estimate a country's number of capabilities from
international export data; these measures predict economic growth better than
conventional variables such as human capital. This paper offers a simpler
measure of a country's knowhow, Log Product Diversity (or LPD, the logarithm of
a country's number of products), which can be derived from a one-parameter
combinatorial model of production in which a set of knowhows combine with some
probability to turn raw materials into a product. ECI and log-fitness can be
interpreted theoretically (using the combinatorial model) and empirically as
potentially noisy estimates of LPD; moreover, controlling for natural
resources, the simple measure better explains the cross-country differences in
GDP and in GDP per capita.

  Data","  Economic growth in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, countries of the
former USSR, Africa and Latin America were analysed. It is demonstrated that
the fundamental postulate of the Unified Growth Theory about the existence of
the three regimes of growth (Malthusian regime, post-Malthusian regime and
sustained-growth regime) is contradicted by data. These regimes did not exist.
In particular, there was no escape from the Malthusian trap because there was
no trap. Economic growth in all these regions was not stagnant but hyperbolic.
Unified Growth Theory is fundamentally incorrect. However, this theory is also
dangerously misleading because it claims a transition from the endless epoch of
stagnation to the new era of sustained economic growth, the interpretation
creating the sense of security and a promise of prosperity. The data show that
the opposite is true. Economic growth in the past was sustained and secure.
Now, it is supported by the increasing ecological deficit. The long-term
sustained and secure economic growth has yet to be created. It did not happen
automatically, as suggested incorrectly by the Unified Growth Theory.

  Route for Economic Growth","  Economic complexity reflects the amount of knowledge that is embedded in the
productive structure of an economy. By combining tools from network science and
econometrics, a robust and stable relationship between a country's productive
structure and its economic growth has been established. Here we report that not
only goods but also services are important for predicting the rate at which
countries will grow. By adopting a terminology which classifies manufactured
goods and delivered services as products, we investigate the influence of
services on the country's productive structure. In particular, we provide
evidence that complexity indices for services are in general higher than those
for goods, which is reflected in a general tendency to rank countries with
developed service sector higher than countries with economy centred on
manufacturing of goods. By focusing on country dynamics based on experimental
data, we investigate the impact of services on the economic complexity of
countries measured in the product space (consisting of both goods and
services). Importantly, we show that diversification of service exports and its
sophistication can provide an additional route for economic growth in both
developing and developed countries.

accurate, the interpretation of historical events from the figures obtained is

problems arising mainly from deep economic inequalities, but they were often
nothing more than declarations of good intentions. Spain suffered in the
aftermath of the international economic downturn as it began to be felt at the
end of the dictatorship of General Primo de Rivera. Economic policy was
developed under the Constitution,but, despite the differences between the first
and second biennium, there was a tendency to maintain the guidelines from the
previous stage and in general, sometimes unfairly, it aimed at least to avoid
the destabilization of the financial system. Nonetheless, it ultimately failed
to achieve its goals, mainly because of the frequent changes of government
mediated by a social crisis of greater significance that had relegated economic
issues into the background.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00729v1,The Economics and Econometrics of Gene-Environment Interplay,"  Economists and social scientists have debated the relative importance of
nature (one's genes) and nurture (one's environment) for decades, if not
centuries. This debate can now be informed by the ready availability of genetic
data in a growing number of social science datasets. This paper explores the
potential uses of genetic data in economics, with a focus on estimating the
interplay between nature (genes) and nurture (environment). We discuss how
economists can benefit from incorporating genetic data into their analyses even
when they do not have a direct interest in estimating genetic effects. We argue
that gene--environment (GxE) studies can be instrumental for (i) testing
economic theory, (ii) uncovering economic or behavioral mechanisms, and (iii)
analyzing treatment effect heterogeneity, thereby improving the understanding
of how (policy) interventions affect population subgroups. We introduce the
reader to essential genetic terminology, develop a conceptual economic model to
interpret gene-environment interplay, and provide practical guidance to
empirical researchers.

fundamental and applied research. Yet, despite important advances, the policy
implications of economic complexity remain unclear or misunderstood. Here I

on 4 Ws: what approaches, focused on identifying target activities and/or
locations; when approaches, focused on timing support for related and unrelated
activities; where approaches, focused on the geographic diffusion of knowledge;
and who approaches, focused on the role played by agents of structural change.
The goal of this paper is to provide a framework that groups, organizes, and
clarifies the policy implications of economic complexity to facilitate its
continued use in regional and international development.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00818v2,Economic complexity and inequality at the national and regional level,"  Recent studies have found evidence of a negative association between economic
complexity and inequality at the country level. Moreover, evidence suggests
that sophisticated economies tend to outsource products that are less desirable
(e.g. in terms of wage and inequality effects), and instead focus on complex
products requiring networks of skilled labor and more inclusive institutions.
Yet the negative association between economic complexity and inequality on a
coarse scale could hide important dynamics at a fine-grained level. Complex
economic activities are difficult to develop and tend to concentrate spatially,
leading to 'winner-take-most' effects that spur regional inequality in
countries. Large, complex cities tend to attract both high- and low-skills
activities and workers, and are also associated with higher levels of
hierarchies, competition, and skill premiums. As a result, the association
between complexity and inequality reverses at regional scales; in other words,
more complex regions tend to be more unequal. Ideas from polarization theories,
institutional changes, and urban scaling literature can help to understand this
paradox, while new methods from economic complexity and relatedness can help
identify inclusive growth constraints and opportunities.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04813v2,The explosive value of the networks,"  Networks have always played a special role for human beings in shaping social
relations, forming public opinion, and driving economic equilibria. Nowadays,
online networked platforms dominate digital markets and capitalization
leader-boards, while social networks drive public discussion. Despite the
importance of networks in many economic and social domains (economics,
sociology, anthropology, psychology,...), the knowledge about the laws that
dominate their dynamics is still scarce and fragmented. Here, we analyse a wide
set of online networks (those financed by advertising) by investigating their
value dynamics from several perspectives: the type of service, the geographic
scope, the merging between networks, and the relationship between economic and
financial value. The results show that the networks are dominated by strongly
nonlinear dynamics. The existence of non-linearity is often underestimated in
social sciences because it involves contexts that are difficult to deal with,
such as the presence of multiple equilibria -- some of which are unstable. Yet,
these dynamics must be fully understood and addressed if we aim to understand
the recent evolution in the economic, political and social milieus, which are
precisely characterised by corner equilibria (e.g., polarization,
winner-take-all solutions, increasing inequality) and nonlinear patterns.

metrics of economic complexity derived from the geography of trade, thus
missing key information on innovative activities. To bridge this gap, we

to build models that significantly and robustly improve the ability of economic
complexity metrics to explain international variations in inclusive green
growth. We show that measures of complexity built on trade and patent data

countries that score high in all three metrics tend to exhibit lower emission
intensities. These findings illustrate how the geography of trade, technology,

the actual and counterfactual values for GDP growth rate and economic
efficiency in Zhoushan is analyzed to determine the treatment effect of the
National New Area policy. The research reveals that in the initial four years,
the New Area policy enhanced Zhoushan's economic efficiency but negatively
affected its GDP growth rate. This influence gradually disappeared after four
years. Further analysis suggests that the policy's effect on GDP growth rate
varies with the level of economic development in different regions, having a
more substantial impact in less developed areas. Therefore, we conclude that
establishing a New Area in relatively undeveloped zones is more advantageous.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1413v1,Competitive market for multiple firms and economic crisis,"  The origin of economic crises is a key problem for economics. We present a
model of long-run competitive markets to show that the multiplicity of
behaviors in an economic system, over a long time scale, emerge as statistical
regularities (perfectly competitive markets obey Bose-Einstein statistics and
purely monopolistic-competitive markets obey Boltzmann statistics) and that how
interaction among firms influences the evolutionary of competitive markets. It
has been widely accepted that perfect competition is most efficient. Our study
shows that the perfectly competitive system, as an extreme case of competitive
markets, is most efficient but not stable, and gives rise to economic crises as
society reaches full employment. In the economic crisis revealed by our model,
many firms condense (collapse) into the lowest supply level (zero supply,
namely bankruptcy status), in analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation. This
curious phenomenon arises because perfect competition (homogeneous
competitions) equals symmetric (indistinguishable) investment direction, a fact
abhorred by nature. Therefore, we urge the promotion of monopolistic
competition (heterogeneous competitions) rather than perfect competition. To
provide early warning of economic crises, we introduce a resolving index of
investment, which approaches zero in the run-up to an economic crisis. On the
other hand, our model discloses, as a profound conclusion, that the
technological level for a long-run social or economic system is proportional to
the freedom (disorder) of this system; in other words, technology equals the
entropy of system. As an application of this new concept, we give a possible
answer to the Needham question: ""Why was it that despite the immense
achievements of traditional China it had been in Europe and not in China that
the scientific and industrial revolutions occurred?""

http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5072v3,Metabolic fluxes and value production,"  Metabolic fluxes in cells are governed by physical, physiological, and
economic principles. Here I assume an optimal allocation of enzyme resources
and postulate a general principle for metabolism: each enzyme must convert less
valuable into more valuable metabolites to justify its own cost. The ""values"",
called economic potentials, describe the individual contributions of
metabolites to cell fitness. Local value production implies that the cost of an
enzyme must be balanced by a benefit, given by the economic potential
difference the catalysed reaction multiplied by the flux. Flux profiles that
satisfy this principle - i.e. for which consistent potentials can be found -
are called economical. Economical fluxes must lead from lower to higher
economic potentials, so certain flux cycles are incompatible with any choice of
economic potentials and can be excluded. To obtain economical flux profiles,
non-beneficial local patterns, called futile motifs, can be systematically
removed from a given flux distribution. The principle of local value production
resembles thermodynamic principles and complements them in models. Here I
describe a modelling framework called Value Balance Analysis (VBA) that uses
the two principles and yields the same solution as enzyme cost minimisation (in
kinetic models) and flux cost minimisation (in FBA). Given an economical flux
distribution, kinetic models in enzyme-optimal states and with these fluxes can
be constructed systematically. VBA justifies the principle of minimal fluxes
and the exclusion of futile cycles, predicts enzymes that could be plausible
targets for regulation, provides criteria for the usage of enzymes and
pathways, and explains the choice between high-yield and low-yield flux modes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00878v1,On the Use of Computer Programs as Money,"  Money is a technology for promoting economic prosperity. Over history money
has become increasingly abstract, it used to be hardware, gold coins and the
like, now it is mostly software, data structures located in banks. Here I
propose the logical conclusion of the abstraction of money: to use as money the
most general form of information - computer programs. The key advantage that
using programs for money (program-money) adds to the technology of money is
agency. Program-money is active and thereby can fully participate in economics
as economic agents. I describe the three basic technologies required to
implement program-money: computational languages/logics to unambiguously
describe the actions and interactions of program-money; computational
cryptography to ensure that only the correct actions and interactions are
performed; and a distributed computational environment in which the money can
execute. I demonstrate that most of the technology for program-money has
already been developed. The adoption of program-money transfers responsibility
from human economic agents to money itself and has great potential economic
advantages over the current passive form of money. For example in
microeconomics, adding agency to money will simplify the exchange of ownership,
ensure money is only used legally, automate the negotiation and forming of
contracts, etc. Similar advantages occur in macroeconomics, where for example
the control of the money supply could be transferred from central banks to
money. It is also possible to envisage money that is not owned by any external
human agent or corporation. One motivation for this is to force economic
systems to behave more rationally and/or more like a specific economic theory,
thereby increasing the success of economic forecasting.

GDP) of Indian districts and cities based on scaling analyses of the dependence
of these quantities on associated population size. Scaling analysis provides a
straightforward method for the identification of network effects in
socioeconomic organization, which are the tell-tale of cities and urbanization.
For districts, a sub-state regional administrative division in India, we find
almost linear scaling of GDP with population, a result quite different from
urban functional units in other national contexts. Using deviations from
scaling, we explore the behavior of these regional units to find strong
distinct geographic patterns of economic behavior. We characterize these
patterns in detail and connect them to the literature on regional economic
development for a diverse subcontinental nation such as India. Given the
paucity of economic data for Urban Agglomerations in India, we use a set of
assumptions to create a new dataset of GDP based on districts, for large
cities. This reveals superlinear scaling of income with city size, as expected
from theory, while displaying similar underlying patterns of economic geography
observed for district economic performance. This analysis of the economic
performance of Indian cities is severely limited by the absence of
higher-fidelity, direct city level economic data. We discuss the need for
standardized and consistent estimates of the size and change in urban economies
in India, and point to a number of proxies that can be explored to develop such

countries. Although there have been extensive studies on countries' economic
complexity using international export data, studies on economic complexity at

prefectures and industrial sectors. We decompose the bipartite network as a
prefecture-prefecture network and sector-sector network, which reveals the
relationships among them. Similarities among the prefectures and among the

the prefectures and sectors using the minimal spanning tree technique.The

economic surplus model. MF incidence in sample buffaloes and cows was 19% and
28%, respectively. Total economic losses were calculated as a sum total of
losses from milk production, mortality of animals and treatment costs. Yearly
economic loss due to MF was estimated to be INR 1000 crores (US$ 137 million)
in Haryana. Value of milk lost had the highest share in total economic losses
(58%), followed by losses due to mortality (29%) and treatment costs (13%).
Despite lower MF incidence, losses were higher in buffaloes due to higher milk
prices and market value of animals. The efficiency gain accruing to producers
if MF is prevented, resulting from increased milk production at decreased costs
was estimated at INR 10990 crores (US$ 1.5 billion). As the potential gain if
prevented is around 10 times the economic losses, this study calls for the use
of preventive technology against MF.

  Practice Based on the Dualistic System Economics in China","  The existing theorization of development economics and transition economics

analyze a dual economic system such as that in China. China is a country in the
transition of dual structure and system. The reform of its economic system has
brought off a long period of transformation. The allocation of factors is
subjected to the dualistic regulation of planning or administration and market

institutional distortions of population birth, population flow, land
transaction and housing supply, with the changing of export, may cause great
influences on the production demand, which includes the iterative contraction
of consumption, the increase of export competitive cost, the widening of
urban-rural income gap, the transferring of residents' income and the crowding
out of consumption. In view of the worldwide shift from a conservative model
with more income than expenditure to the debt-based model with more expenditure
than income and the need for loose monetary policy, we must explore a basic
model that includes variables of debt and land assets that affecting money
supply and price changes, especially in China, where the current debt ratio is
high and is likely to rise continuously. Based on such a logical framework of
dualistic system economics and its analysis method, a preliminary calculation
system is formed through the establishment of models.

  based on the empirical coupling to economic growth","  Growth in the global human population this century will have momentous
consequences for societies and the environment. Population growth has come with
higher aggregate human welfare, but also climate change and biodiversity loss.
Based on the well-established empirical association and plausible causal
relationship between economic and population growth, we devised a novel method
for forecasting population based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
Although not mechanistically causal, our model is intuitive, transparent,
replicable, and grounded on historical data. Our central finding is that a
richer world is likely to be associated with a lower population, an effect
especially pronounced in rapidly developing countries. In our baseline
scenario, where GDP per capita follows a business-as-usual trajectory, global
population is projected to reach 9.2 billion in 2050 and peak in 2062. With 50%
higher annual economic growth, population peaks even earlier, in 2056, and
declines to below 8 billion by the end of the century. Without any economic
growth after 2020, however, the global population will grow to 9.9 billion in
2050 continue rising thereafter. Economic growth has the largest effect on
low-income countries. The gap between the highest and lowest GDP scenarios
reaches almost 4 billion by 2100. Education and family planning are important
determinants of population growth, but economic growth is also likely to be a
driver of slowing population growth by changing incentives for childbearing.
Since economic growth could slow population growth, it will offset
environmental impacts stemming from higher per-capita consumption of food,
water, and energy, and work in tandem with technological innovation.

  drives irreproducibility","  Several systematic studies have suggested that a large fraction of published
research is not reproducible. One probable reason for low reproducibility is
insufficient sample size, resulting in low power and low positive predictive
value. It has been suggested that insufficient sample-size choice is driven by
a combination of scientific competition and 'positive publication bias'. Here
we formalize this intuition in a simple model, in which scientists choose
economically rational sample sizes, balancing the cost of experimentation with
income from publication. Specifically, assuming that a scientist's income
derives only from 'positive' findings (positive publication bias) and that
individual samples cost a fixed amount, allows to leverage basic statistical
formulas into an economic optimality prediction. We find that if effects have
i) low base probability, ii) small effect size or iii) low grant income per
publication, then the rational (economically optimal) sample size is small.
Furthermore, for plausible distributions of these parameters we find a robust
emergence of a bimodal distribution of obtained statistical power and low
overall reproducibility rates, both matching empirical findings. Finally, we
explore conditional equivalence testing as a means to align economic incentives
with adequate sample sizes. Overall, the model describes a simple mechanism
explaining both the prevalence and the persistence of small sample sizes, and
is well suited for empirical validation. It proposes economic rationality, or
economic pressures, as a principal driver of irreproducibility and suggests
strategies to change this.

  Consumer Behaviors","  In economics literature, it is accepted that all people are rational and they
try to maximize their utilities as possible as they can. In addition, economic
theories are formed with the assumptions not suitable to real life. For
instance, indifference curves are drawn with the assumptions that there are two
goods, people are rational, more is preferred to less and so on. Hence, the
consumer behaviors are guessed according to this analysis. Nevertheless, these
are invalid in real life. And this inconsistencey are examined by behavioral
economics and neuroeconomics. Behavioral economics claims that people can
behave what they are not expected since people can be irrational, their
willpower is limited and altruistic behaviors can be seen and they can give
more value to what they own. As a result of these, consumer behaviors become
more different than that of economic theory. In addition to behavioral
economics, neuroeconomics also examines consumer behaviors more differently
than mainstream economic theory. It emphasizes the people using prefrontial
cortex of the brain are more rational than the people using hippocampus of the
brain. Therefore, people can make illogical choices compared to economic
theory. In these cases, levying taxes such as personal income tax or value
added tax can be ineffective or effective. In other words, the effect becomes
ambigious. Hence,the hypothesis that if government desires to levy personal
income tax or value added tax, it makes a detailed research in terms of
productivity of taxes forms the fundamental of this study.

similar frameworks for modeling economic behavior as invented in physics. This
has not been successful, however, and current state of the process is the
neoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using a static
framework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic
quantities because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a
positive profit maximizing flow of production does not exist. Due to these
problems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of a profit-seeking
firm where the adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important,
currently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future
bankruptcies of firms due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can
solve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several
parameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model
of a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the
reasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in
physics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is
more important for the development of economics than pure mathematics. (JEL

The framework integrates some elements of different schools of thought and
overcomes some restrictions inherent to optimization approaches, such as the

proportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points.
Disentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19
cases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different
mitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress.
Methods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021
data to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19.
We combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly:
COVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public
policies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic
and mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent
variables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path
coefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to
February 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the
U.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies
where businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19
cases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the
same period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental
distress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity
decreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential
causal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression
is 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%. Thus, we show that period t-1 COVID-19 case

great interest to those looking for asset allocation guidance in the current

traditional data sources because it is easy to collect and highly abundant. Our
work focuses on studying the potential of textual data, in particular news

fundamentals with an impact on their policy, investment and saving decisions.
Most of the previous work using news articles for measuring EPU are either
manual or based on a simple keyword search. Our work proposes a machine
learning based solution involving weak supervision to classify news articles
with regards to economic policy uncertainty. Weak supervision is shown to be an
efficient machine learning paradigm for applying machine learning models in low

and heuristics. We further generated a weak supervision based EPU index that we
used to conduct extensive econometric analysis along with the Irish

high fear of infection and strict restrictions similarly harm the economy but
reduce infections; (b) low-income workers bear the brunt of both the economic
and epidemic harm; (c) closing non-customer-facing industries such as
manufacturing and construction only marginally reduces the death toll while
considerably increasing unemployment; and (d) delaying the start of protective

renewing the need for durable peace agreements. In this paper, I evaluate the
economic effects of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and
the largest guerrilla group in the country, the FARC, putting an end to one of
the longest and most violent armed conflicts in recent history. Using a
difference-in-difference strategy comparing municipalities that historically
had FARC presence and those with presence of a similar, smaller guerrilla
group, the ELN, before and after the start of a unilateral ceasefire by the
FARC, I establish three sets of results. First, violence indicators
significantly and sizably decreased in historically FARC municipalities.
Second, despite this large reduction in violence, I find precisely-estimated
null effects across a variety of economic indicators, suggesting no effect of
the peace agreement on economic activity. Furthermore, I use a sharp
discontinuity in eligibility to the government's flagship business and job
creation program for conflict-affected areas to evaluate the policy's impact,
also finding precisely-estimated null effects on the same economic indicators.
Third, I present evidence that suggests the reason why historically FARC
municipalities could not reap the economic benefits from the reduction in
violence is a lack of state capacity, caused both by their low initial levels
of state capacity and the lack of state entry post-ceasefire. These results
indicate that peace agreements require complementary investments in state
capacity to yield an economic dividend.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05826v3,Improving the Economic Complexity Index,"  How much knowledge is there in an economy? In recent years, data on the mix
of products that countries export has been used to construct measures of
economic complexity that estimate the knowledge available in an economy and
predict future economic growth. Here we introduce a new and simpler metric of
economic complexity (ECI+) that measures the total exports of an economy
corrected by how difficult it is to export each product. We use data from 1973
to 2013 to compare the ability of ECI+, the Economic Complexity Index (ECI),
and Fitness complexity, to predict future economic growth using 5, 10, and
20-year panels in a pooled OLS, a random effects model, and a fixed effects
model. We find that ECI+ outperforms ECI and Fitness in its ability to predict
economic growth and in the consistency of its estimators across most
econometric specifications. On average, one standard deviation increase in ECI+
is associated with an increase in annualized growth of about 4% to 5%. We then
combine ECI+ with measures of physical capital, human capital, and
institutions, to find a robust model of economic growth. The ability of ECI+ to
predict growth, and the value of its coefficient, is robust to these controls.
Also, we find that human capital, political stability, and control of
corruption; are positively associated with future economic growth, and that
income is negatively associated with growth, in agreement with the traditional
growth literature. Finally, we use ECI+ to generate economic growth predictions
for the next 20 years and compare these predictions with the ones obtained
using ECI and Fitness. These findings improve the methods available to estimate
the knowledge intensity of economies and predict future economic growth.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02683v1,"Classicals versus Keynesians: Fifty Distinctions between Two Major
  Schools of Economic Thought","  Macroeconomics essentially discusses macroeconomic phenomena from the
perspectives of various schools of economic thought, each of which takes
different views on how macroeconomic agents make decisions and how the
corresponding markets operate. Therefore, developing a clear, comprehensive
understanding of how and in what ways these schools of economic thought differ
is a key and a prerequisite for economics students to prosper academically and
professionally in the discipline. This becomes even more crucial as economics
students pursue their studies toward higher levels of education and graduate
school, during which students are expected to attain higher levels of Bloom's
taxonomy, including analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and creation. Teaching the
distinctions and similarities of the two major schools of economic thought has
never been an easy task to undertake in the classroom. Although the reason for
such a hardship can be multi-fold, one reason has undoubtedly been students'
lack of a holistic view on how the two mainstream economic schools of thought
differ. There is strong evidence that students make smoother transition to
higher levels of education after building up such groundwork, on which they can
build further later on (e.g. Didia and Hasnat, 1998; Marcal and Roberts, 2001;
Islam, et al., 2008; Green, et al., 2009; White, 2016). The paper starts with a
visual spectrum of various schools of economic thought, and then narrows down
the scope to the classical and Keynesian schools, i.e. the backbone of modern
macroeconomics. Afterwards, a holistic table contrasts the two schools in terms
of 50 aspects. Not only does this table help economics students enhance their
comprehension, retention, and critical-thinking capability, it also benefits

http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6496v1,Theoretical frameworks for neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice,"  Intertemporal choice has drawn attention in behavioral economics,
econophysics, and neuroeconomics. Recent studies in mainstream economics have
mainly focused on inconsistency in intertemporal choice (dynamic
inconsistency); while impulsivity/impatience in intertemporal choice has been
extensively studied in behavioral economics of addiction. However, recent
advances in neuroeconomic and econophysical studies on intertemporal choice
have made it possible to study both impulsivity and inconsistency in
intertemporal choice within a unified framework. In this paper I propose the
new frameworks for investigations into neuroeconomics of intertemporal choice.
The importance of studying neurochemical and neuroendocrinological modulations
of intertemporal choice and time-perception (e.g. serotonin, dopamine,
cortisol, testosterone, and epinephrine) is emphasized.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2798v1,Reciprocity as the foundation of Financial Economics,"  This paper argues that the fundamental principle of contemporary financial
economics is balanced reciprocity, not the principle of utility maximisation
that is important in economics more generally. The argument is developed by
analysing the mathematical Fundamental Theory of Asset Pricing with reference
to the emergence of mathematical probability in the seventeenth century in the
context of the ethical assessment of commercial contracts. This analysis is
undertaken within a framework of Pragmatic philosophy and Virtue Ethics. The
purpose of the paper is to mitigate future financial crises by reorienting
financial economics to emphasise the objectives of market stability and social
cohesion rather than individual utility maximisation.

empirically accurate models of inflation and interest rates, and can be used to
motivate a 'statistical economics', analogous to statistical mechanics for

production systems (aPS) in case of extending, reducing or modifying parts,
several approaches propose an encapsulation and clustering of related
functions, e.g. from the electrical, mechanical or software engineering, based
on a modular architecture. Considering the development of these modules, there
are different stages, e.g. module planning or functional engineering, which
have to be completed. A reference model that addresses the different stages for
the engineering of aPS is proposed by AutomationML. Due to these different
stages and the integration of several engineering disciplines, e.g. mechanical,
electrical/electronic or software engineering, information not limited to one
discipline are stored redundantly increasing the effort to transfer information
and the risk of inconsistency. Although, data formats for the storage and
exchange of plant engineering information exist, e.g. AutomationML, fixed
domain specific structures and relations of the information, e.g. for automated
material flow systems (aMFS), are missing. This paper presents the integration

proposes a practical and readily to be adopted modelling solution for these
communities, one that allows their members to share the economic benefits
derived from them. The proposed solution relies on an \emph{ex-post} allocation
of the electricity that is generated within energy communities (i.e., local
electricity) based on the optimisation of \emph{repartition keys}. Repartition
keys are therefore optimally computed to represent the proportion of total
local electricity to be allocated to each community member, and aim to minimise
the sum of electricity bills of all community members. Since the optimisation
takes place \emph{ex-post} the repartition keys do not modify the actual
electricity flows, but rather the financial flows of the community members.
Then, the billing process of the community will take these keys into account to
correctly send the electricity bills to each member. Building on this concept,
we also introduce two additions to the basic algorithm to enhance the stability
of the community, which a global bill minimisation may fail to ensure (e.g.,
very asymmetrical solutions between members may lead to some of them opting
out).

Center for Computer Science offers substantial opportunities for renovations.
To alleviate this concern, we propose Block-SSD. Block-SSD takes a basic block,
formed out of a page, and physically combines these blocks into larger blocks.
Those blocks are then formed into a larger door block, which cover most of the
professor's door. To our knowledge, we are the first to design a block-based
blocking Sabotaging Saugata's Door (SSD) architecture.

  membranes","  Developing 'smart' membranes that allow precise and reversible control of
molecular permeation using external stimuli would be of intense interest for
many areas of science: from physics and chemistry to life-sciences. In
particular, electrical control of water permeation through membranes is a
long-sought objective and is of crucial importance for healthcare and related
areas. Currently, such adjustable membranes are limited to the modulation of
wetting of the membranes and controlled ion transport, but not the controlled
mass flow of water. Despite intensive theoretical work yielding conflicting
results, the experimental realisation of electrically controlled water
permeation has not yet been achieved. Here we report electrically controlled
water permeation through micrometre-thick graphene oxide (GO) membranes. By
controllable electric breakdown, conductive filaments are created in the GO
membrane. The electric field concentrated around such current carrying
filaments leads to controllable ionisation of water molecules in graphene
capillaries, allowing precise control of water permeation: from ultrafast
permeation to complete blocking. Our work opens up an avenue for developing
smart membrane technologies and can revolutionize the field of artificial
biological systems, tissue engineering and filtration.

management system and its application to Southern Peru smelter. It is composed
of an hourly demand-forecasting module and of a simulation component for a
plant electrical system. The first module was done using dynamic neural
networks with backpropagation training algorithm; it is used to predict the
electric power demanded every hour, with an error percentage below of 1%. This
information allows efficient management of energy peak demands before this
happen, distributing the raise of electric load to other hours or improving
those equipments that increase the demand. The simulation module is based in
advanced estimation techniques, such as: parametric estimation, neural network
modeling, statistic regression and previously developed models, which simulates
the electric behavior of the smelter plant. These modules facilitate
electricity demand and consumption proper planning, because they allow knowing
the behavior of the hourly demand and the consumption patterns of the plant,
including the bill components, but also energy deficiencies and opportunities
for improvement, based on analysis of information about equipments, processes
and production plans, as well as maintenance programs. Finally the results of
its application in Southern Peru smelter are presented.

interpreting measured field electron emission (FE) current-voltage [I(V)]
characteristics. It is commonly assumed that I(V) data interpretation is a
problem in emission physics and related electrostatics. Many experimentalists
then apply Fowler-Nordheim plot methodology, developed in 1929. However, with
modern emitting materials this 90-year-old interpretation methodology often
fails (maybe in nearly 50% of cases), and yields spurious values for
characterization parameters, particularly field enhancement factors. This has
generated an unreliable literature, and validity checks on experimental I(V)
data are nearly always needed before use. A new check, supplementing existing
checks, is described. Twelve different ""system complications"" that, acting
singly or in combinations, can cause validity-check failure are identified. A
top-level path forwards from this unsatisfactory situation is proposed. The
term ""field electron emission system (FE system)"" is defined to include all
aspects of an experimental system that affect the measured I(V)
characteristics. The analysis of FE systems should now be regarded as a
specialized form of electronic/electrical engineering, provisionally called ""FE
Systems Engineering"". In this approach, the I(V) relationship is split: (a) the
current is expressed as a function I(F_C) of the local surface-field magnitude
F_C at some defined emitter surface location ""C""; and (b) the relationship
between F_C and measured voltage V is expressed and determined separately.
Determining I(F_C) is mostly a problem in emission physics; determining the
relationship (F_C)(V) depends on system electrostatics and (for systems failing
a validity check) on other aspects of FE Systems Engineering. The scope of FE
Systems Engineering, and some related research implications and problems, are

of which shares a unique Yamada polynomial. Finally, within each topological
class, 3D geometric models are generated using the spatial graph diagrams

generation. As a unique technology for producing direct-current electricity
without moving parts, it can be utilized within a high-temperature topping
power cycle to be combined with a traditional bottoming power cycle, forming a
combined-cycle MHD system. This study presents governing equations for the
electric field and current density field within a moving plasma subject to an
applied magnetic field. The modeling equations are described at four descending
levels of complexity. Starting with the first level of modeling, which is the
most general case, where no assumptions are made regarding the electric field,
plasma velocity field, applied magnetic field, or electrode geometry. In the
second level of modeling, the magnetic field is treated as one-dimensional. In
the third level of modeling, a specific Faraday-type magnetohydrodynamics
plasma generator channel is considered, having two continuous electrodes acting
as parallel constant-voltage terminals. In the fourth (and simplest) level of
modeling, an additional approximation is made by setting the Hall parameter to
zero and replacing all vector fields with scalar quantities. For that simplest
model, a representative set of operation conditions (electric conductivity 20
S/m, temperature 2800 K, supersonic plasma gas speed 2000 m/s with Mach 2.134,
and magnetic flux density 5 T) shows that the optimum idealized electric power
that can be extracted from a unit volume of plasma is estimated as 500 MW/m3.

An integrated approach to electrification planning in which traditional grid
electrification is complemented off-the-grid technologies such as off-grid
microgrids and stand-alone systems can enable the economic provision of
electricity access in these regions. This integrated planning approach can be
facilitated by determining the least-cost mode of electrification - i.e by

achieve this purpose. This methodology involves exploiting the grid network

clusters of consumers to be electrified by grid-extension and off-grid
microgrid systems. Using test cases and sensitivity analyses, we implement and
benchmark this top-down approach with those obtained from a bottom-up

interfaces between centrosymmetric cubic materials, such as LaAlO$_3$ and
SrTiO$_3$, where a polar discontinuity across the boundary gives rise to
polarization charges and electric fields that drive a metal-insulator
transition, with the appearance of free carriers at the interface.
Two-dimensional analogues of these systems are possible, and honeycomb lattices
could offer a fertile playground, thanks to their versatility and the extensive
on-going experimental efforts in graphene and related materials. Here we
suggest different realistic pathways to engineer polar discontinuities across
interfaces between honeycomb lattices, and support these suggestions with
extensive first-principles calculations. Two broad approaches are discussed,
that are based on (i) nanoribbons, where a polar discontinuity against the
vacuum emerges, and (ii) selective functionalizations, where covalent ligands
are used to engineer polar discontinuities by selective or total
functionalization of the parent system. All the cases considered have the
potential to deliver innovative applications in ultra-thin and flexible
solar-energy devices and in micro- and nano-electronics.

and technology. Thermoelectric nanoscale heat engines convert heat flows into
useful work in the form of electrical power and promise the realization of
on-chip power production. Considerable studies have so far revealed the
potentials to yield an enhanced efficiency originating from quantum confinement
effects and energy-dependent transport properties. However, the full benefit of
many-body interactions in thermoelectric is yet to be investigated; identifying
the optimal interaction is a hard problem due to combinatorial explosion of the
search space, which makes brute-force searches infeasible. Here we tackle this
problem with reinforcement learning of network topology in interacting
electronic systems, and identify a set of the best thermoelectric nanoscale
engines. Harnessing many-body interactions, we show that the maximum possible
values of the thermoelectric figure of merit and the power factor can be
enhanced by orders of magnitudes for generic single-electron levels. This
allows for simple and flexible design of realizing the asymptotic Carnot
efficiency with subextensive, but still nonzero and stable power. To realize
the optimal nanoscale engines, we propose concrete physical setups based on
quantum-dot arrays. The developed framework of reinforcement learning through
evolving network topology thus enables one to identify full potential of
nanoscale systems.

  of Ultralow Thermal Conductivity Materials","  Boundary-engineering in nanostructures has the potential to dramatically
impact the development of materials for high-efficiency conversion of thermal
energy directly into electricity. In particular, nanostructuring of
semiconductors can lead to strong suppression of heat transport with little
degradation of electrical conductivity. Although this combination of material
properties is promising for thermoelectric materials, it remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel concept, the directional phonon
suppression function, to unravel boundary-dominated heat transport in
unprecedented detail. Using a combination of density functional theory and the
Boltzmann transport equation, we compute this quantity for nanoporous silicon
materials. We first compute the thermal conductivity for the case with aligned
circular pores, confirming a significant thermal transport degradation with
respect to the bulk. Then, by analyzing the information on the directionality
of phonon suppression in this system, we identify a new structure of
rectangular pores with the same porosity that enables a four-fold decrease in
thermal transport with respect to the circular pores. Our results illustrate
the utility of the directional phonon suppression function, enabling new
avenues for systematic thermal conductivity minimization and potentially
accelerating the engineering of next-generation thermoelectric devices.

  Analysis of Conductors","  The electrostatic modeling of conductors is a fundamental challenge in
various applications, including the prediction of parasitic effects in
electrical interconnects, the design of biasing networks, and the modeling of
biological, microelectromechanical, and sensing systems. The boundary element
method (BEM) can be an effective simulation tool for these problems because it
allows modeling three-dimensional objects with only a surface mesh. However,
existing BEM formulations can be restrictive because they make assumptions
specific to particular applications. For example, capacitance extraction
formulations usually assume a constant electric scalar potential on the surface
of each conductor and cannot be used to model a flowing current, nor to extract
the resistance. When modeling steady currents, many existing techniques do not
address mathematical challenges such as the null space associated with the
operators representing the internal region of a conductor. We propose a more
general BEM framework based on the electric scalar potential for modeling
conductive objects in various scenarios in a unified manner. Restrictive
application-specific assumptions are not made, and the aforementioned operator
null space is handled in an intuitive and rigorous manner. Numerical examples
drawn from diverse applications confirm the accuracy and generality of the
proposed method.

other is collected from the non-resident sectors, including different

  Conductances in Phosphorene","  Thermoelectric devices that utilize the Seebeck effect convert heat flow into
electrical energy and are highly desirable for the development of portable,
solid state, passively-powered electronic systems. The conversion efficiencies
of such devices are quantified by the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of
merit (ZT), which is proportional to the ratio of a device's electrical
conductance to its thermal conductance. High ZT (>2) has been achieved in
materials via all-scale hierarchical architecturing. This efficiency holds at
high temperatures (700K~900K) but quickly diminishes at lower temperatures. In
this paper, a recently-fabricated two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor called
phosphorene (monolayer black phosphorus) is assessed for its thermoelectric
capabilities. First-principles and model calculations reveal that phosphorene
possesses spatially-anisotropic electrical and thermal conductances. The
prominent electrical and thermal conducting directions are orthogonal to one
another, enhancing the ratio of these conductances. As a result, ZT can reach
2.5 (the criterion for commercial deployment) along the armchair direction of
phosphorene at T=500K and is greater than 1 even at room temperature given
moderate doping (~2 x 10^16 m-2). Ultimately, phosphorene stands out as an
environmentally sound thermoelectric material with unprecedented qualities:
intrinsically, it is a mechanically flexible material that converts heat energy
with high efficiency at low temperatures (~ 300K) - one whose performance does
not require any sophisticated engineering techniques.

devices and formulate an optimization problem for the minimum-power design.
First, we provide a mathematical model to capture the frequency-dependant
signal propagation effect in the DMA architecture. Next, we propose a solution
based on semi-definite programming and alternating optimization. Results show
that a DMA-based structure can outperform a fully-digital implementation and
that the required transmit power decreases with the antenna array size, while
it increases and remains almost constant with frequency in DMA and FD,

However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are
inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model

neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical
stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this

an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated
up to the population description.We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct
electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off
oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain
and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field
strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating
that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of

reproduce structural plasticity by creating structures of controllable shape.
We demonstrate gradual topologies evolution in a multi-electrode configuration.
We conduct a detail electrical characterization of the PEDOT:PSS dendrites
through DC and impedance spectroscopy measurements and we show how organic
electrochemical transistors (OECT) can be realized with these structures. These
measurements reveal that quasi-static and transient response of OECTs can be

dendrites are used to demonstrate short-term, long-term and structural

of electrical devices such as coils, motors, relays, solenoids and transformers
is heavily dependent on the Electrical Insulation System (EIS). Accelerated
aging methods are used to rapidly simulate the conditions in real life, which
is typically years (20,000 hours) depending on the operating conditions. The
purpose of accelerated aging is to bring lifetime of an EIS to hours, days or
weeks. Shortening the lifetime of an EIS to such an extent, allows for the
study of the insulation materials behavior as well as investigate ways to
estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for the purpose of predictive
maintenance. Unexpected failures in operation processes, where redundancy is
not present, can lead to high economical losses, machine downtime and often
health and safety risks. Conditions, under which thermal aging methods are
generally reported in the literature, typically neglect other factors, owing to
the sheer complexity and interdependence of the multifaceted aging phenomena.
This paper examines some existing thermal aging tests, which are currently used
to obtain data for enamel degradation in order to try to better understand of
how the thermal stresses degrade the EIS. Separation of these stresses, which
the EIS operate under, can yield a better understanding of how each of the

that is widely used to detect sulfide minerals, clay minerals, metallic
objects, municipal wastes, hydrocarbons, and salinity intrusion. However, SIP
is a static method that cannot measure the dynamics of flow and solute/species
transport in the subsurface. To capture these dynamics, the data collected with
the SIP technique needs to be coupled with fluid flow and reactive-transport
models. To our knowledge, currently, there is no simulator in the open-source
literature that couples fluid flow, solute transport, and SIP process models to
analyze geoelectrical signatures in a large-scale system. A massively parallel
simulation framework (PFLOTRAN-SIP) was built to couple SIP data to fluid flow
and solute transport processes. This framework built on the PFLOTRAN-E4D
simulator that couples PFLOTRAN and E4D, without sacrificing computational
performance. PFLOTRAN solves the coupled flow and solute transport process
models to estimate solute concentrations, which were used in Archie's model to
compute bulk electrical conductivities at near-zero frequency. These bulk
electrical conductivities were modified using the Cole-Cole model to account
for frequency dependence. Using the estimated frequency-dependent bulk
conductivities, E4D simulated the real and complex electrical potential signals
for selected frequencies for SIP. The PFLOTRAN-SIP framework was demonstrated
through a synthetic tracer-transport model simulating tracer concentration and

http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01754v1,A Peer-to-Peer Energy Management Solution for Maximum Social Welfare,"  In smart energy communities, prosumers who both generate and consume energy
play a crucial role in shaping energy management strategies. These communities
use advanced platforms that enable prosumers to actively engage in the local
electricity markets by setting and adjusting their own energy prices. Through
peer to peer (P2P) energy trading systems, members can directly exchange energy
derived from sources such as solar photovoltaic panels, electric vehicle
battery storage, and demand response (DR) programs. This direct exchange not
only enhances the efficiency of the network but also fosters a dynamic energy
market within the community. In this article, parking-sharing services for EVs
and the mechanisms of P2P energy scheduling, which facilitates the transfer and
communication of power among different energy communities (ECs) are addressed.
It focuses on integrating solar power, responsive electrical loads, and
electric vehicles (EVs) to optimize both economic returns and social benefits
for all participants. The system is designed to ensure that all energy
transactions are transparent and beneficial to the proactive consumers
involved. Moreover, due to urban traffic conditions and the challenges of
finding suitable locations for EV charging and parking, houses in these

energy management and urban scheduling illustrates a holistic approach to
addressing both energy and transportation challenges, ultimately leading to
more sustainable urban environments.

Dielectric Elastomer Actuator (DEA) behaves like a flexible artificial muscles

exact beam, where the electric charges serve as control variables. The DEA-beam
is integrated as an actuator into multibody systems consisting of rigid and

unilateral constraints between the beam actuator and e.g. a rigid body during
the grasping process of a soft robot. Specifically for the DEA, a work
conjugated electric displacement and strain-like electric variables are derived
for the Cosserat beam. With a mathematically concise and physically
representative formulation, a reduced free energy function is developed for the
beam-DEA. In the optimal control problem, an objective function is minimized
while the dynamic balance equations for the multibody system have to be
fulfilled together with the complementarity conditions for the contact and
boundary conditions. The optimal control problem is solved via a direct
transcription method, transforming it into a constrained nonlinear optimization
problem. The beam is firstly semidiscretized with 1D finite elements and then
the multibody dynamics is temporally discretized with a variational integrator
leading to the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations, which are further reduced
with the null space projection. The discrete Euler-Lagrange equations and the

capability of fully electric vehicles has to be taken into account in designing
braking controllers like ABS and yaw stability control through differential
braking. Fully electric vehicles are usually lighter vehicles with different

Experimental results also demonstrate that our method is robust in various

  ferroelectrics revealed by in-situ x-ray diffraction","  Strain engineering of perovskite oxide thin films has proven to be an
extremely powerful method for enhancing and inducing ferroelectric behavior. In
ferroelectric thin films and superlattices, the polarization is intricately
linked to crystal structure, but we show here that it can also play an
important role in the growth process, influencing growth rates, relaxation
mechanisms, electrical properties and domain structures. We have studied this
effect in detail by focusing on the properties of BaTiO$_{3}$ thin films grown
on very thin layers of PbTiO$_{3}$ using a combination of x-ray diffraction,
piezoforce microscopy, electrical characterization and rapid in-situ x-ray
diffraction reciprocal space maps during the growth using synchrotron
radiation. Using a simple model we show that the changes in growth are driven
by the energy cost for the top material to sustain the polarization imposed
upon it by the underlying layer, and these effects may be expected to occur in
other multilayer systems where polarization is present during growth. Our
research motivates the concept of polarization engineering during the growth
process as a new and complementary approach to strain engineering.

synaptogenesis in the brain, in which electrical stimulation in the brain
causes the formation of synapses from the cellular neural composites. The
strategy has been recently explored for neuromorphic engineering by
establishing link between the electrical signals and the dendrites' shapes.
Since the geometry of these structures determines their electrochemical
properties, understanding the mechanisms that regulate the polymer assembly

into account the important features of spatial-temporal potential mapping based
on the time-varying signal, the motion of charged particles in the liquid due

wire-like growth, while lower frequency leads to more dense and fractal
dendrites growth, and voltage offset leads to asymmetrical growth. We find that
dendrites' shape and growth process systematically depend on particle

  Degradation","  The increasing uptake of electrical vehicles (EVs) has increased the
awareness of battery degradation costs and how they can be minimized. However,
from a planning perspective it is difficult to integrate battery degradation
models into existing route planning models and to assess how policies that aim
at reducing battery degradation affect route planning costs and degradation
across the fleet. In this paper, a simple transportation vehicle routing
problem (VRP) is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem (MINLP), with
a modification that allows monitoring the maximum and minimum
depth-of-discharge (DoD) of the entire fleet. This allows us to measure the
battery health degradation during the online optimization process. The results
show that accounting for the impact of different route characteristics on
battery degradation can have an impact on the route planning of the entire
fleet as well as the battery degradation for all vehicles. The latter is
achieved by forcing vehicles to adapt to certain DoD boundaries in the long
term.

makes it possible to engineer logic gates by exploiting spin wave buses as
passive logic elements providing a certain phase-shift to the propagating spin
waves. We present a library of logic gates consisting of magneto-electric cells
and spin wave buses providing 0 or p phase shifts. The utilization of phases in
addition to amplitudes is a powerful tool which let us construct logic circuits
with a fewer number of elements than required for CMOS technology. As an
example, we present the design of the magnonic Full Adder Circuit comprising

  fractional-order systems for the joint estimation of parameters and

solve the initial value problem of fractional-order systems (FOS) is both
complex and essential in defining the dynamical behavior of the states of FOSs.
In this paper, we investigate the use of the initialization functions for the
purpose of estimating unknown parameters of linear non-commensurate FOSs. In
particular, we propose a novel ""pre-initial"" process that describes the dynamic
characteristic of FOSs before the initial state and consists of designing an
appropriate time-varying initialization function that ensures accurate
convergence of the estimates of the unknown parameters. To do so, we propose an
estimation technique that consists of two steps: (i) to design of practical
initialization function that is output-dependent and which is employed; (ii) to
solve the joint estimation problem of both parameters and fractional
differentiation orders (FDOs). A convergence proof has been presented. The
performance of the proposed method is illustrated through different numerical
examples. Potential applications of the algorithm to joint estimation of
parameters and FDOs of the fractional arterial Windkessel and neurovascular
models are also presented using both synthetic and real data. The added value
of the proposed ""pre-initial"" process to solve the studied estimation problem
is shown through different simulation tests that investigate the sensitivity of
estimation results using different time-varying initialization functions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13663v1,"Mathematical modeling for sustainability: How can it promote sustainable
  learning in mathematics education?","  This article reviews the current state of teaching and learning mathematical
modeling in the context of sustainable development goals for education at the
tertiary level. While ample research on mathematical modeling education and
published textbooks on the topic are available, there is a lack of focus on
mathematical modeling for sustainability. This review aims to address this gap
by exploring the powerful intersection of mathematical modeling and
sustainability. Mathematical modeling for sustainability connects two distinct
realms: learning about the mathematics of sustainability and promoting
sustainable learning in mathematics education. The former involves teaching and
learning sustainability quantitatively, while the latter encompasses pedagogy
that enables learners to apply quantitative knowledge and skills to everyday
life and continue learning and improving mathematically beyond formal
education. To demonstrate the practical application of mathematical modeling
for sustainability, we discuss a specific textbook suitable for a pilot liberal
arts course. We illustrate how learners can grasp mathematical concepts related
to sustainability through simple yet mathematically diverse examples, which can
be further developed for teaching such a course. Indeed, by filling the gap in
the literature and providing practical resources, this review contributes to
the advancement of mathematical modeling education in the context of
sustainability.

Whereas the axioms and metaphysical ideas of these theories have been carefully

remedy this situation. We give an account of what warrants mathematical
representation of phenomenal experience, derive a general mathematical
framework which takes into account consciousness' epistemic context and study
which mathematical structures some of the key characteristics of conscious
experience imply, showing precisely where mathematical approaches allow to go
beyond what the standard methodology can do. The result is a general
mathematical framework for models of consciousness that can be employed in the

mathematics. This program can produce conjectures which are not implied by
existing (published) theorems. Here we propose a new approach to push forward
existing mathematical research goals---using automated mathematical discovery
software. We suggest how to initiate and harness large-scale collaborative
mathematics. We envision mathematical research labs similar to what exist in
other sciences, new avenues for funding, new opportunities for training
students, and a more efficient and effective use of published mathematical
research.
  And our experiment in graph theory can be imitated in many other areas of
mathematical research. Big Mathematics is the idea of large, systematic,
collaborative research on problems of existing mathematical interest. What is
possible when we put our skills, tools, and results together systematically?

Foundations of mathematics of this type fail to satisfactory perform more basic

using the received set-theoretic foundations for meta-mathematical purposes

http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07974v1,"Tree-Based Representation and Generation of Natural and Mathematical
  Language","  Mathematical language in scientific communications and educational scenarios
is important yet relatively understudied compared to natural languages. Recent
works on mathematical language focus either on representing stand-alone
mathematical expressions, especially in their natural tree format, or
mathematical reasoning in pre-trained natural language models. Existing works
on jointly modeling and generating natural and mathematical languages simply
treat mathematical expressions as text, without accounting for the rigid
structural properties of mathematical expressions. In this paper, we propose a
series of modifications to existing language models to jointly represent and
generate text and math: representing mathematical expressions as sequences of
node tokens in their operator tree format, using math symbol and tree position
embeddings to preserve the semantic and structural properties of mathematical
expressions, and using a constrained decoding method to generate mathematically
valid expressions. We ground our modifications in GPT-2, resulting in a model
MathGPT, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on mathematical
expression generation tasks.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05123v1,"The Physicalization of Metamathematics and Its Implications for the
  Foundations of Mathematics","  Both metamathematics and physics are posited to emerge from samplings by
observers of the unique ruliad structure that corresponds to the entangled
limit of all possible computations. The possibility of higher-level mathematics
accessible to humans is posited to be the analog for mathematical observers of
the perception of physical space for physical observers. A physicalized
analysis is given of the bulk limit of traditional axiomatic approaches to the
foundations of mathematics, together with explicit empirical metamathematics of
some examples of formalized mathematics. General physicalized laws of
mathematics are discussed, associated with concepts such as metamathematical
motion, inevitable dualities, proof topology and metamathematical
singularities. It is argued that mathematics as currently practiced can be
viewed as derived from the ruliad in a direct Platonic fashion analogous to our
experience of the physical world, and that axiomatic formulation, while often
convenient, does not capture the ultimate character of mathematics. Among the
implications of this view is that only certain collections of axioms may be
consistent with inevitable features of human mathematical observers. A
discussion is included of historical and philosophical connections, as well as
of foundational implications for the future of mathematics.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11713v1,A useful ethics framework for mathematics teachers,"  An argument is presented that mathematics teachers would benefit from an
ethics framework that allows them to reflect upon their position regarding the
teaching of ethics within mathematics. We present such a framework, adapted
from Chiodo and Bursill-Hall's (2018) levels of ethical engagement for
mathematicians, with discussion of its applications and implications. Awareness
of ethical and social responsibility amongst mathematicians and mathematics
educators is a newly established field, and yet it is crucially important, if
we are to use mathematics for good and the avoidance of harm - in other words
to use mathematics for justice, belonging, peace, care, education, lawmaking,
building, creativity, equity, connection, fairness, rulemaking and order. Here,
we present a way to extend ideas from ethics in the field of mathematics for
mathematicians to the field of mathematics education for mathematics teachers,
aiming to contribute to this transdisciplinary work and to advance the field
further. We also explore links to ideas of equity, and silence and voice,
drawing on the consequences of a deeper examination of the entanglements of
mathematical-ethical dilemmas for mathematics teachers both inside and outside
the classroom.

it from cultural practices. These two hurdles are overcome by cluster analysis
of the keywords of included studies. Existing research falls into two
categories: I. identification of mathematical concepts used in Indigenous
societies, and II. systematizing identified mathematical concepts. Both
approaches are essential for research on Indigenous mathematics to flourish, in
order to empower Indigenous knowledge holders and deconstruct restrictive
colonial boundaries of mathematical knowledge and education.

sense logic can ""explain"". For example, let's consider the basic concept of an
axiomatic system: an axiomatic system can be very useful to organize, to
present, and to clarify mathematical knowledge. And, more importantly, logic is
a science with its own results: so, axiomatic systems are interesting also
because we know several revealing theorems about them. Similarly, I will
discuss other topics such as mathematical definitions, and some relationships
between mathematical logic and computer science. I will also consider these
subjects from an educational point of view: can logical concepts be useful in

these questions. But these beliefs are usually in a big contrast with the
recent cognitive theoretic findings concerning mathematics. Contemporary
cognitive science opens new approaches to reformulate the fundamental questions
concerning mathematics and helps mathematicians break through the Platonic
beliefs about the essence and sources of mathematical knowledge. In this

fundamental processes such as symbolic/formal and visual/spatial ones. Two
different aspects of mathematics should be separated in mathematical cognition.
One aspect considers mathematics as an explicit crystallized knowledge. The
other aspect considers mathematics as an ongoing and transient mental
processing. The cognitive processes and corresponding tasks involved in these
aspects are different. Ongoing mathematical activities both elementary and
advanced, demand working memory resources. Using dual-task techniques, we
design some pilot experiments to differentiate the symbolic/formal and
visual/spatial processes. Using this memory theoretic approach, we explain the
crucial roles of language-based processes such as verbal articulation and
instructive speech and also visuo-spatial intuition such as spatial imagery and
mental movement in various aspects of mathematics.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12478v1,Is mathematics a game?,"  We re-examine the old question to what extent mathematics may be compared to
a game. Under the spell of Wittgenstein, we propose that the more refined
object of comparison is a ""motley of language games"", the nature of which was
(implicitly) clarified by Hilbert: via different language games, axiomatization
lies at the basis of both the rigour and the applicability of mathematics. In
the ""formalist"" game, mathematics resembles chess via a clear conceptual
dictionary. Accepting this resemblance: like positions in chess, mathematical
sentences cannot be true or false; true statements in mathematics are about
sentences, namely that they are theorems (if they are). In principle, the
certainty of mathematics resides in proofs, but to this end, in practice these
must be ""surveyable"". Hilbert and Wittgenstein proposed almost oppositie
criteria for surveyability; we try to overcome their difference by invoking
computer-verified proofs. The ""applied""' language game is based on Hilbert's
axiomatization program for physics (and other scientific disciplines), refined
by Wittgenstein's idea that theorems are yardsticks to which empirical
phenomena may be compared, and further improved by invoking elements of van
Fraassen's constructive empiricism. From this perspective, in an appendix we
also briefly review the varying roles and structures of axioms, definitions,
and proofs in mathematics. Our view is not meant as a philosophy of mathematics
by itself, but as a coat rack analogous to category theory, onto which various
(traditional and new) philosophies of mathematics (such as formalism,
intuitionism, structuralism, deductivism, and the philosophy of mathematical
practice) may be attached and may even peacefully support each other.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0900v1,"Mathematical practice, crowdsourcing, and social machines","  The highest level of mathematics has traditionally been seen as a solitary
endeavour, to produce a proof for review and acceptance by research peers.
Mathematics is now at a remarkable inflexion point, with new technology
radically extending the power and limits of individuals. Crowdsourcing pulls
together diverse experts to solve problems; symbolic computation tackles huge
routine calculations; and computers check proofs too long and complicated for
humans to comprehend.
  Mathematical practice is an emerging interdisciplinary field which draws on
philosophy and social science to understand how mathematics is produced. Online
mathematical activity provides a novel and rich source of data for empirical
investigation of mathematical practice - for example the community question
answering system {\it mathoverflow} contains around 40,000 mathematical
conversations, and {\it polymath} collaborations provide transcripts of the
process of discovering proofs. Our preliminary investigations have demonstrated
the importance of ""soft"" aspects such as analogy and creativity, alongside
deduction and proof, in the production of mathematics, and have given us new
ways to think about the roles of people and machines in creating new
mathematical knowledge. We discuss further investigation of these resources and
what it might reveal.
  Crowdsourced mathematical activity is an example of a ""social machine"", a new
paradigm, identified by Berners-Lee, for viewing a combination of people and

international research endeavours. We outline a future research agenda for

repositories by now: different mathematical theorems and theories have been
taken into consideration and included in mathematical repositories.
Applications more distant from pure mathematics, however --- though based on
these theories --- often need more detailed knowledge about the underlying
theories. In this paper we present an example Mizar formalization from the area
of electrical engineering focusing on stability theory which is based on
complex analysis. We discuss what kind of special knowledge is necessary here
and which amount of this knowledge is included in existing repositories.

it might be reasonable or even necessary to duplicate knowledge in a

so and provide a number of examples supporting our thesis.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12513v1,"Theodorus' lesson in Plato's Theaetetus (147d1-d6) Revisited-A New
  Perspective","  This article is the first part of a study of the so-called 'mathematical
part' of Plato's Theaetetus (147d-148b). The subject of this 'mathematical
part' is the irrationality, one of the most important topics in early Greek
mathematics. As of huge interest for mathematicians, historians of mathematics
as well as of philosophy, there had been an avalanche of studies about it. In
our work, we revisit this question, for we think something is missing: a global
analysis of Plato's text, from these three points of view simultaneously:
history, mathematics and philosophy. It is what we have undertook through a new
translation, a new interpretation of the mathematical lesson about irrational
magnitudes and a novel interpretation of the whole passage from these three
points of view. Our guideline is considering Plato's writings seriously, not as
some playful work. This simple rule is indeed surprisingly constraining, but it
allows us to get a rare direct glance inside pre-Euclidean mathematics, in
contradiction with the 'Main Standard Interpretation' prevailing in history of
mathematics as well as in history of philosophy. This study had been divided in
two parts for editorial reasons. In the present article, we propose an analysis
of the first part of this 'mathematical part', Theodorus' lesson. In the second
article (Brisson-Ofman (to appear)), we present the sequel of the lesson and a
philosophical interpretation of the 'mathematical part' within the framework of
the entire dialogue. Both articles form a whole. They are both aimed to an
audience without any particular mathematical background, and require only
elementary mathematical knowledge, essentially of high school-level. Some more
delicate points are nevertheless developed in the Appendices.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11577v1,Mathematical Entities: Corpora and Benchmarks,"  Mathematics is a highly specialized domain with its own unique set of
challenges. Despite this, there has been relatively little research on natural
language processing for mathematical texts, and there are few mathematical
language resources aimed at NLP. In this paper, we aim to provide annotated
corpora that can be used to study the language of mathematics in different
contexts, ranging from fundamental concepts found in textbooks to advanced
research mathematics. We preprocess the corpora with a neural parsing model and
some manual intervention to provide part-of-speech tags, lemmas, and dependency
trees. In total, we provide 182397 sentences across three corpora. We then aim
to test and evaluate several noteworthy natural language processing models
using these corpora, to show how well they can adapt to the domain of
mathematics and provide useful tools for exploring mathematical language. We
evaluate several neural and symbolic models against benchmarks that we extract
from the corpus metadata to show that terminology extraction and definition
extraction do not easily generalize to mathematics, and that additional work is
needed to achieve good performance on these metrics. Finally, we provide a
learning assistant that grants access to the content of these corpora in a
context-sensitive manner, utilizing text search and entity linking. Though our
corpora and benchmarks provide useful metrics for evaluating mathematical
language processing, further work is necessary to adapt models to mathematics
in order to provide more effective learning assistants and apply NLP methods to
different mathematical domains.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5530v1,Fundamental Dilemmas in Theoretical Physics,"  In this paper, we argue that there are foundational dilemmas in theoretical
physics related to the concept of reality and the nature of mathematics in
physics. Physical theory is treated as a conceptual organism which develops
under the weight of its internal contradictions. The paper discusses in depth
the problem of objective reality in physics and its relation to scientific
practice. Then, it explores the problematic relation between physical meaning
and mathematics in modern physical theory, followed by a discussion of the
trend of contemporary physics to replace physical principles with pure
mathematical principles. Finally, it discusses the problem of logical coherence
in modern physical theory. The paper emphasizes the importance of resolving
these dilemmas to the proper practice of theoretical physics.

mathematical branch will be applied during the physical analysis in the systems

physics, and quantum physics, especially in quantum field theory, is nothing
else than the difference between the mathematics that is used on both branches
of the physics. A common physical and mathematical origin for the analysis of
the different systems brings both forms (quantum and classic) of understanding
the nature mechanisms closer to each other.

interdisciplinary physics should become a cabinet of curiosities including an
incubator. The cabinet of curiosities would welcome all one shots papers
related to any kind of object provided it is co-authored at least by one
physicist. Otherwise the paper should uses explicitly technics from physics. In
case a topic gets many papers, it would be moved to the incubator to foster the
potential emergence of a new appropriate subfield of physics. A process
illustrated by the subsection social physics in Frontiers in physics.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0008048v1,Intersections 2000: What's New in Hadron Physics,"  Hadron physics is that part of QCD dealing with hadron structure and vacuum
structure, almost all of which is nonperturbative in nature. Some of the open
problems in this field are outlined. We argue that hadron physics is a distinct
subfield, no longer within particle physics, and not at all the same as
classical nuclear physics. We believe that it needs to be better organized, and
that a first step in doing so might be to establish hadron physics as a new
division within the American Physical Society.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0106021v3,2T-Physics 2001,"  The physics that is traditionally formulated in one--time-physics
(1T-physics) can also be formulated in two-time-physics (2T-physics). The
physical phenomena in 1T or 2T physics are not different, but the spacetime
formalism used to describe them is. The 2T description involves two extra
dimensions (one time and one space), is more symmetric, and makes manifest many
hidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families of
apparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographically
describe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are two
timelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins out
spacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. The
gauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in a
spacetime with two timelike dimensions. What is gained through 2T-physics is a
unification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries and
relationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence for
the presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure.
2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of
1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of the
unified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. In
these lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theory
formulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the results
obtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.

relationships between required mathematics and physics courses in various years
is important for contemplating how the courses build on each other and whether
there is need to make changes to the curriculum for the majors to strengthen
these relationships. We use 15 years of institutional data at a large research
university to investigate how introductory physics and mathematics courses
predict male and female physics majors' performance on required advanced
physics and mathematics courses. We used Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) to
investigate these predictive relationships and find that among introductory and
advanced physics and mathematics courses, there are gender differences in
performance in favor of male students only in the introductory physics courses
after controlling for high school GPA. We found that a measurement invariance
fully holds in a multi-group SEM by gender, so it was possible to carry out
analysis with gender mediated by introductory physics and high school GPA.
Moreover, we find that these introductory physics courses that have gender
differences do not predict performance in advanced physics courses. Also,
introductory mathematics courses predict performance in advanced mathematics
courses which in turn predict performance in advanced physics courses.
Furthermore, apart from the introductory physics courses that do not predict
performance in future physics courses, there is a strong predictive
relationship between the sophomore, junior and senior level physics courses.

physics identity is critical to increase diversity within the field of physics
and to understand what changes can allow more women and minorities to identify
with the field. In this study, we investigate informal physics programs as
spaces for physics identity exploration. These programs provide unique
conditions under which to study physics identity development along with other
identities. Informal physics spaces allow for voluntary engagement, as well as
elements of agency and autonomy within the exploration of physics. Thus these
spaces allow an identity to form outside of the constraints traditionally found
in academic settings. In this work, we operationalized the Community of
Practice (CoP) framework to study the development of physics identities within
university students who facilitate informal physics programs. We present the
stories from two physics graduate students out of our sample to provide a
context for testing the feasibility of the extended framework and to identify
how experiences within an informal physics program can shape physics identity
development. This paper presents the operationalized constructs within the
Community of Practice framework, how these constructs are applied to the
narrated experiences of our participants, and highlights how we can use this
framework to understand the nuances of physics identity development as well as
the factors that can influence that development.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6970v1,The P versus NP Problem in Quantum Physics,"  Motivated by the fact that information is encoded and processed by physical
systems, the P versus NP problem is examined in terms of physical processes. In
particular, we consider P as a class of deterministic, and NP as
nondeterministic, polynomial-time physical processes. Based on these
identifications, we review a self-reference physical process in quantum theory,
which belongs to NP but cannot be contained in P.

transformations. Thus the squeeze transformation is one of the fundamental

http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0608268v1,Problem Solving and the Use of Math in Physics Courses,"  Mathematics is an essential element of physics problem solving, but experts
often fail to appreciate exactly how they use it. Math may be the language of
science, but math-in-physics is a distinct dialect of that language. Physicists
tend to blend conceptual physics with mathematical symbolism in a way that
profoundly affects the way equations are used and interpreted. Research with
university physics students in classes from algebra-based introductory physics
indicates that the gap between what students think they are supposed to be
doing and what their instructors expect them to do can cause severe problems.

highly simplified or toy models. In introductory physics classes, we tend to

http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11126v1,Three facets of mathematical cancer biology research,"  Cancer, as the uncontrollable cell growth, is related to many branches of
biology. In this review, we will discuss three mathematical approaches for
studying cancer biology: population dynamics, gene regulation, and
developmental biology. If we understand all biochemical mechanisms of cancer
cells, we can directly calculate how the cancer cell population behaves.
Inversely, just from the cell count data, we can use population dynamics to
infer the mechanisms. Cancer cells emerge from certain genetic mutations, which
affect the expression of other genes through gene regulation. Therefore,
knowledge of gene regulation can help with cancer prevention and treatment.
Developmental biology studies acquisition and maintenance of normal cellular
function, which is inspiring to cancer biology in the opposite direction.
Besides, cancer cells implanted into an embryo can differentiate into normal
tissues, which provides a possible approach of curing cancer. This review
illustrates the role of mathematics in these three fields: what mathematical
models are used, what data analysis tools are applied, and what mathematical
theorems need to be proved. We hope that applied mathematicians and even pure
mathematicians can find meaningful mathematical problems related to cancer
biology.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00033v1,A framework for philosophical biology,"  Advances in biology have mostly relied on theories that were subsequently
revised, expanded or eventually refuted using experimental and other means.
Theoretical biology used to primarily provide a basis to rationally examine the
frameworks within which biological experiments were carried out and to shed
light on overlooked gaps in understanding. Today, however, theoretical biology
has generally become synonymous with computational and mathematical biology.
This could in part be explained by a relatively recent tendency in which a
""data first"", rather than a ""theory first"", approach is preferred. Moreover,
generating hypotheses has at times become procedural rather than theoretical.
This situation leaves our understanding enmeshed in data, which should be
disentangled from much noise. Given the many unresolved questions in biology
and medicine, it seems apt to revive the role of pure theory in the biological
sciences. This paper makes the case for a ""philosophical biology""
(philbiology), distinct from but quite complementary to philosophy of biology
(philobiology), which would entail biological investigation through
philosophical approaches. Philbiology would thus be a reincarnation of
theoretical biology, adopting the true sense of the word ""theory"" and making
use of a rich tradition of serious philosophical approaches in the natural
sciences. A philbiological investigation, after clearly defining a given
biological problem, would aim to propose a set of empirical questions, along
with a class of possible solutions, about that problem. Importantly, whether or
not the questions can be tested using current experimental paradigms would be
secondary to whether the questions are inherently empirical or not. The final
goal of a philbiological investigation would be to develop a theoretical
framework that can lead observational and/or interventional experimental
studies of the defined problem.

difficult - especially when new experimental data cannot be gathered. We
demonstrate a method that uses structural biology predictions to augment
systems biology models to improve systems biology models' predictions without
having to gather more experimental data. Additionally, we show how systems
biology models' predictions can help evaluate novel structural biology
hypotheses, which may also be expensive or infeasible to validate.

  lessons from 30 years of physics education research","  If students are to successfully grapple with authentic, complex biological
problems as scientists and citizens, they need practice solving such problems
during their undergraduate years. Physics education researchers have
investigated student problem solving for the last three decades. Although
physics and biology problems differ in structure and content, the instructional
purposes align closely: explaining patterns and processes in the natural world
and making predictions about physical and biological systems. In this paper, we
discuss how research-supported approaches developed by physics education
researchers can be adopted by biologists to enhance student problem-solving
skills. First, we compare the problems that biology students are typically
asked to solve with authentic, complex problems. We then describe the
development of research-validated physics curricula emphasizing process skills
in problem solving. We show that solving authentic, complex biology problems
requires many of the same skills that practicing physicists and biologists use
in representing problems, seeking relationships, making predictions, and
verifying or checking solutions. We assert that acquiring these skills can help
biology students become competent problem solvers. Finally, we propose how
biology scholars can apply lessons from physics education in their classrooms
and inspire new studies in biology education research.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3203v2,Foundations of biology,"  It is often stated that there are no laws in biology, where everything is
contingent and could have been otherwise, being solely the result of historical
accidents. Furthermore, the customary introduction of fundamental biological
entities such as individual organisms, cells, genes, catalysts and motors
remains largely descriptive; constructive approaches involving deductive
reasoning appear, in comparison, almost absent. As a consequence, both the
logical content and principles of biology need to be reconsidered. The present
article describes an inquiry into the foundations of biology. The foundations
of biology are built in terms of elements, logic and principles, using both the
language and the general methods employed in other disciplines. This approach
assumes the existence of a certain unity of human knowledge that transcends
discipline boundaries. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason is revised
through the introduction of the complementary concepts of symmetry and
asymmetry and of necessity and contingency. This is used to explain how these
four concepts are involved in the elaboration of theories or laws of nature.
Four fundamental theories of biology are then identified: cell theory, Darwin's
theory of natural selection, an informational theory of life (which includes
Mendel's theory of inheritance) and a physico-chemical theory of life. Atomism
and deductive reasoning are shown to enter into the elaboration of the concepts
of natural selection, individual living organisms, cells and their
reproduction, genes as well as catalysts and motors. This work contributes to
clarify the philosophical and logical structure of biology and its major
theories. This should ultimately lead to a better understanding of the origin
of life, of system and synthetic biology, and of artificial life.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0980v1,Global View of Bionetwork Dynamics: Adaptive Landscape,"  Quantifying the adaptive landscape in a given dynamical processes has been
one of most important goals in theoretical biology. It can have immediate
implications for many dynamical properties, such as robustness and plasticity.
Based on recent work here I give a nontechnical brief review of this powerful
quantitative concept in biology. This concept was initially proposed by S
Wright 70 years ago, re-introduced by one of the founders of molecular biology
and by others in different biological contexts. It was apparently forgotten by
mainstream modern biologists for many years. Currently, this concept has found
its increasingly important role in the development of systems biology and the
modeling of bionetwork dynamics, from phage lambda genetic switch to endogenous
network of cancer genesis and progression. It is an ideal quantify to describe
the robustness and stability of bionetworks. I will first introduce five
landmark proposals in biology on this concept, to demonstrate the important
common thread in its theoretical biology development. Then I will discuss a few
recent results, focusing on the work showing the logical consistency of
adaptive landscape. From the perspective of a working scientist and of what
needed for a dynamical theory when confronting empirical data, the adaptive
landscape is useful both metaphorically and quantitatively and has captured an
essential aspect of biological dynamical processes. Still, many important open
problems remain to be solved. Having this important problem under control, we
may expect that we are on the right road to quantitatively formulate the
evolutionary dynamics discovered by Darwin and Wallace.

neglects effect size, is universally misinterpreted, and is disastrously prone
to error when combined with high-throughput cell biology. The first part of the
solution proposed here is to limit statistical hypothesis testing to the small
subset of experiments where a biologically meaningful null hypotheses can be
defined prior to the experiment. The second part of the solution is to make
confidence intervals the default statistic in cell biology.

principles of engineering and the knowledge of biological networks to program
the behavior of cells. Computational modeling techniques in conjunction with
molecular biology techniques have been successful in constructing biological
devices such as switches, oscillators, and gates. The ambition of synthetic
biology is to construct complex systems from such fundamental devices, much in
the same way electronic circuits are built from basic parts. As this ambition
becomes a reality, engineering concepts such as interchangeable parts and
encapsulation will find their way into biology. We realize that there is a need
for computational tools that would support such engineering concepts in
biology. As a solution, we have developed the software Athena that allows
biological models to be constructed as modules. Modules can be connected to one
another without altering the modules themselves. In addition, Athena houses
various tools useful for designing synthetic networks including tools to
perform simulations, automatically derive transcription rate expressions, and
view and edit synthetic DNA sequences. New tools can be incorporated into
Athena without modifying existing program via a plugin interface, IronPython
scripts, Systems Biology Workbench interfacing and the R statistical language.
The program is currently for Windows operating systems, and the source code for
Athena is made freely available through CodePlex, www.codeplex.com/athena.

radically different role in this discipline, when compared to those in current
physics. By this comparison, we stress that symmetries must be understood in
relation to conservation and stability properties, as represented in the
theories. We posit that the dynamics of biological organisms, in their various
levels of organization, are not ""just"" processes, but permanent (extended, in
our terminology) critical transitions and, thus, symmetry changes. Within the
limits of a relative structural stability (or interval of viability),
variability is at the core of these transitions.

Here, we present the Automated Recommendation Tool (ART), a tool that leverages

  Systems Biology: lambda Switch as a Working Example","  Phage lambda is one of the most studied biological models in modern molecular
biology. Over the past 50 years quantitative experimental knowledge on this
biological model has been accumulated at all levels: physics, chemistry,
genomics, proteomics, functions, and more. All its components have been known
to a great detail. The theoretical task has been to integrate its components to
make the organism working quantitatively in a harmonic manner. This would test
our biological understanding and would lay a solid fundamental for further
explorations and applications, an obvious goal of systems biology. One of the
outstanding challenges in doing so has been the so-called stability puzzle of
lambda switch: the biologically observed robustness and its difficult
mathematical reconstruction based on known experimental values. In this chapter
we review the recent theoretical and experimental efforts on tackling this
problem. An emphasis is put on the minimum quantitative modeling where a
successful numerical agreement between experiments and modeling has been
achieved. A novel method tentatively named stochastic dynamical structure
analysis emerged from such study is also discussed within a broad modeling
perspective.

and the rate of information acquisition by the chemotaxis pathway. We find that
E. coli make behavioral decisions with much less than the 1 bit required to
determine whether they are swimming up-gradient. However, they use this
information efficiently, performing near the theoretical limit. Thus,
information can limit organisms' performance, and sensory-motor pathways may
have evolved to efficiently use information from the environment.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00942v1,Prelude to a Compositional Systems Biology,"  Composition is a powerful principle for systems biology, focused on the
interfaces, interconnections, and orchestration of distributed processes.
Whereas most systems biology models focus on the structure or dynamics of
specific subsystems in controlled conditions, compositional systems biology
aims to connect such models into integrative multiscale simulations. This
emphasizes the space between models--a compositional perspective asks what
variables should be exposed through a submodel's interface? How do coupled
models connect and translate across scales? How can we connect domain-specific
models across biological and physical research areas to drive the synthesis of
new knowledge? What is required of software that integrates diverse datasets
and submodels into unified multiscale simulations? How can the resulting
integrative models be accessed, flexibly recombined into new forms, and
iteratively refined by a community of researchers? This essay offers a
high-level overview of the key components for compositional systems biology,
including: 1) a conceptual framework and corresponding graphical framework to
represent interfaces, composition patterns, and orchestration patterns; 2)
standardized composition schemas that offer consistent formats for composable
data types and models, fostering robust infrastructure for a registry of
simulation modules that can be flexibly assembled; 3) a foundational set of
biological templates--schemas for cellular and molecular interfaces, which can
be filled with detailed submodels and datasets, and are designed to integrate
knowledge that sheds light on the molecular emergence of cells; and 4)
scientific collaboration facilitated by user-friendly interfaces for connecting
researchers with datasets and models, and which allows a community of
researchers to effectively build integrative multiscale models of cellular
systems.

Modeling the time course of omics markers in response to cyclosporine A
exposure at the cell level with a coupled PK-systems biology model. Posterior
statistical distributions of the parameter values were obtained by Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling. Data were well simulated, and the known in vitro toxic

  rule-of-thumb reasoning in cell biology","  ""Back-of-the-envelope"" or ""rule-of-thumb"" calculations involving rough
estimates of quantities play a central scientific role in developing intuition
about the structure and behaviour of physical systems, for example in so-called
`Fermi problems' in the physical sciences. Such calculations can be used to
powerfully and quantitatively reason about biological systems, particularly at
the interface between physics and biology. However, substantial uncertainties
are often associated with values in cell biology, and performing calculations
without taking this uncertainty into account may limit the extent to which
results can be interpreted for a given problem. We present a means to
facilitate such calculations where uncertainties are explicitly tracked through
the line of reasoning, and introduce a `probabilistic calculator' called
Caladis, a web tool freely available at www.caladis.org, designed to perform
this tracking. This approach allows users to perform more statistically robust
calculations in cell biology despite having uncertain values, and to identify
which quantities need to be measured more precisely in order to make confident
statements, facilitating efficient experimental design. We illustrate the use
of our tool for tracking uncertainty in several example biological
calculations, showing that the results yield powerful and interpretable
statistics on the quantities of interest. We also demonstrate that the outcomes
of calculations may differ from point estimates when uncertainty is accurately
tracked. An integral link between Caladis and the Bionumbers repository of
biological quantities further facilitates the straightforward location,
selection, and use of a wealth of experimental data in cell biological
calculations.

systems the correlations account for the organization of cytoskeleton and the
compaction of genetic material. In spite of their ubiquity, the true importance

framework based on Markov processes to represent intracellular processes. We
review the formal relationships between different stochastic models referred to
in the systems biology literature. As part of this review, we present a novel
derivation of the differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for a general
multidimensional Markov process made up of both continuous and jump processes.
We start with the definition of a time-derivative for a probability density but
place no restrictions on the probability distribution, in particular, we do not
assume it to be confined to a region that has a surface (on which the
probability is zero). In our derivation, the master equation gives the jump
part of the Markov process while the Fokker-Planck equation gives the
continuous part. We thereby sketch a {}``family tree'' for stochastic models in
systems biology, providing explicit derivations of their formal relationship
and clarifying assumptions involved.

-- (1) formulating models; (2) analysing models; and (3) fitting or comparing
models to data -- inherent to mathematical biology, researchers currently focus
too much on activity (2) at the cost of (1). This trend, we propose, can be
reversed by realising that any given biological phenomena can be modelled in an
infinite number of different ways, through the adoption of an open/pluralistic
approach. We explain the open approach using fish locomotion as a case study
and illustrate some of the pitfalls -- universalism, creating models of models,
etc. -- that hinder mathematical biology. We then ask how we might rediscover a
lost art: that of creative mathematical modelling.

  inference","  Mathematical models are indispensable to the system biology toolkit for
studying the structure and behavior of intracellular signaling networks. A
common approach to modeling is to develop a system of equations that encode the
known biology using approximations and simplifying assumptions. As a result,
the same signaling pathway can be represented by multiple models, each with its
set of underlying assumptions, which opens up challenges for model selection
and decreases certainty in model predictions. Here, we use Bayesian multimodel
inference to develop a framework to increase certainty in systems biology
models. Using models of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we
first show that multimodel inference increases predictive certainty and yields
predictors that are robust to changes in the set of available models. We then
show that predictions made with multimodel inference are robust to data
uncertainties introduced by decreasing the measurement duration and reducing
the sample size. Finally, we use multimodel inference to identify a new model
to explain experimentally measured sub-cellular location-specific ERK activity
dynamics. In summary, our framework highlights multimodel inference as a
disciplined approach to increasing the certainty of intracellular signaling
activity predictions.

performed by means of proton tunneling between nucleotide and DNA-polimerase

been and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By
which means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,
and eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions
our understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific
theories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems
to have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited
long ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical
properties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc
proposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that
biology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and
life-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and
diffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to
identify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.
While Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later
acclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th
century. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical
approach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long
forsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology
increasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the
mechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our
reluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.

  computational biology","  The drive for reproducibility in the computational sciences has provoked
discussion and effort across a broad range of perspectives: technological,
legislative/policy, education, and publishing. Discussion on these topics is
not new, but the need to adopt standards for reproducibility of claims made
based on computational results is now clear to researchers, publishers and
policymakers alike. Many technologies exist to support and promote reproduction
of computational results: containerisation tools like Docker, literate
programming approaches such as Sweave, knitr, iPython or cloud environments
like Amazon Web Services. But these technologies are tied to specific
programming languages (e.g. Sweave/knitr to R; iPython to Python) or to
platforms (e.g. Docker for 64-bit Linux environments only). To date, no single
approach is able to span the broad range of technologies and platforms
represented in computational biology and biotechnology.
  To enable reproducibility across computational biology, we demonstrate an
approach and provide a set of tools that is suitable for all computational work
and is not tied to a particular programming language or platform. We present
published examples from a series of papers in different areas of computational
biology, spanning the major languages and technologies in the field

most valuable aspect is the decoupling of methods in computational biology from

more ambitiously to foster a huge bioeconomy don't necessarily contrast with

of the issues and describes emerging frameworks for policy and practice that
transverse the options of command-and control, stewardship, bottom-up, and
laissez-faire governance. How to achieve early warning systems that enable
prevention and mitigation of future AI-enabled biohazards from the lab, from
deliberate misuse, or from the public realm, will constantly need to evolve,

these sets of issues, society needs to rethink how AI-enabled synthetic biology
should be governed. The suggested way to visualize the challenge at hand is
whack-a-mole governance, although the emerging solutions are perhaps not so
different either.

http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0605020v1,Laws in Darwinian Evolutionary Theory,"  In the present article the recent works to formulate laws in Darwinian
evolutionary dynamics are discussed. Although there is a strong consensus that
general laws in biology may exist, opinions opposing such suggestion are
abundant. Based on recent progress in both mathematics and biology, another
attempt to address this issue is made in the present article. Specifically,
three laws which form a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics in
biology are postulated. The second law is most quantitative and is explicitly
expressed in the unique form of a stochastic differential equation. Salient
features of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics are captured by this law: the
probabilistic nature of evolution, ascendancy, and the adaptive landscape. Four
dynamical elements are introduced in this formulation: the ascendant matrix,
the transverse matrix, the Wright evolutionary potential, and the stochastic
drive. The first law may be regarded as a special case of the second law. It
gives the reference point to discuss the evolutionary dynamics. The third law
describes the relationship between the focused level of description to its
lower and higher ones, and defines the dichotomy of deterministic and
stochastic drives. It is an acknowledgement of the hierarchical structure in
biology. A new interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural
selection is provided in terms of the F-Theorem. The proposed laws are based on
continuous representation in both time and population. Their generic nature is
demonstrated through their equivalence to classical formulations. The present
three laws appear to provide a coherent framework for the further development
of the subject.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05415v3,Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Dynamical Models in Systems Biology,"  Dynamical systems modeling, particularly via systems of ordinary differential
equations, has been used to effectively capture the temporal behavior of
different biochemical components in signal transduction networks. Despite the
recent advances in experimental measurements, including sensor development and
'-omics' studies that have helped populate protein-protein interaction networks
in great detail, modeling in systems biology lacks systematic methods to
estimate kinetic parameters and quantify associated uncertainties. This is
because of multiple reasons, including sparse and noisy experimental
measurements, lack of detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the reactions,
and missing biochemical interactions. Additionally, the inherent nonlinearities
with respect to the states and parameters associated with the system of
differential equations further compound the challenges of parameter estimation.
In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework for Bayesian parameter
estimation and complete quantification of the effects of uncertainties in the
data and models. We apply these methods to a series of signaling models of
increasing mathematical complexity. Systematic analysis of these dynamical
systems showed that parameter estimation depends on data sparsity, noise level,
and model structure, including the existence of multiple steady states. These
results highlight how focused uncertainty quantification can enrich systems
biology modeling and enable additional quantitative analyses for parameter
estimation.

important psychophysical and experimental similarities between the
neurologically different motion parallax and stereopsis cues. Their
quantitative analysis relied primarily on the ""disparity equivalence""
approximation. In this article we show that retinal motion from lateral
translation satisfies a strong (""asymptotic"") approximation to binocular
disparity. This precise mathematical similarity is also practical in the sense
that it applies at normal viewing distances. The approximation is an extension
to peripheral vision of (Cormac & Fox's 1985) well-known non-trig central
vision approximation for binocular disparity. We hope our simple algebraic
formula will be useful in analyzing experiments outside central vision where
less precise approximations have led to a number of quantitative errors in the
vision literature.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00218v2,Sig-SDEs model for quantitative finance,"  Mathematical models, calibrated to data, have become ubiquitous to make key
decision processes in modern quantitative finance. In this work, we propose a
novel framework for data-driven model selection by integrating a classical
quantitative setup with a generative modelling approach. Leveraging the
properties of the signature, a well-known path-transform from stochastic
analysis that recently emerged as leading machine learning technology for
learning time-series data, we develop the Sig-SDE model. Sig-SDE provides a new
perspective on neural SDEs and can be calibrated to exotic financial products
that depend, in a non-linear way, on the whole trajectory of asset prices.
Furthermore, we our approach enables to consistently calibrate under the
pricing measure $\mathbb Q$ and real-world measure $\mathbb P$. Finally, we
demonstrate the ability of Sig-SDE to simulate future possible market scenarios
needed for computing risk profiles or hedging strategies. Importantly, this new
model is underpinned by rigorous mathematical analysis, that under appropriate
conditions provides theoretical guarantees for convergence of the presented
algorithms.

efficiency. FinRL-Podracer is a cloud solution that features high performance

consider multilayer heat equations, known in physics for a relatively long time

machinery of quantitative finance by augmenting it with the ML method. We
demonstrate how one can solve various problems of mathematical finance by using
our approach. Specifically, we develop efficient algorithms for pricing barrier
options for time-dependent one-factor short-rate models, such as
Black-Karasinski and Verhulst. Besides, we show how to solve the well-known
Dupire equation quickly and accurately. Numerical examples confirm that our
approach is considerably more efficient for solving the corresponding partial
differential equations than the conventional finite difference method by being
much faster and more accurate than the known alternatives.

network structures are better at extracting information from financial time

draw-down of a multi-factor quantitative investment strategy due to their
introducing more information and diversification to the existing factor pool.

http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1974v2,Econophysics: Empirical facts and agent-based models,"  This article aims at reviewing recent empirical and theoretical developments
usually grouped under the term Econophysics. Since its name was coined in 1995
by merging the words Economics and Physics, this new interdisciplinary field
has grown in various directions: theoretical macroeconomics (wealth
distributions), microstructure of financial markets (order book modelling),
econometrics of financial bubbles and crashes, etc. In the first part of the
review, we discuss on the emergence of Econophysics. Then we present empirical
studies revealing statistical properties of financial time series. We begin the
presentation with the widely acknowledged stylized facts which describe the
returns of financial assets- fat tails, volatility clustering, autocorrelation,
etc.- and recall that some of these properties are directly linked to the way
time is taken into account. We continue with the statistical properties
observed on order books in financial markets. For the sake of illustrating this
review, (nearly) all the stated facts are reproduced using our own
high-frequency financial database. Finally, contributions to the study of
correlations of assets such as random matrix theory and graph theory are
presented. In the second part of the review, we deal with models in
Econophysics through the point of view of agent-based modelling. Amongst a
large number of multi-agent-based models, we have identified three
representative areas. First, using previous work originally presented in the
fields of behavioural finance and market microstructure theory, econophysicists
have developed agent-based models of order-driven markets that are extensively
presented here. Second, kinetic theory models designed to explain some
empirical facts on wealth distribution are reviewed. Third, we briefly
summarize game theory models by reviewing the now classic minority game and
related problems.

the discrepancy between the IV smiles for levered and unlevered ETF options. We
construct bootstrap uniform confidence bands which indicate that the implied
volatility smiles are statistically different after moneyness scaling has been
performed. An empirical application shows that there are trading opportunities
possible on the LETF market. A statistical arbitrage type strategy based on a
dynamic semiparametric factor model is presented. This strategy presents a
statistical decision algorithm which generates trade recommendations based on
comparison of model and observed LETF implied volatility surface. It is shown
to generate positive returns with a high probability. Extensive econometric
analysis of LETF implied volatility process is performed including
out-of-sample forecasting based on a semiparametric factor model and uniform
confidence bands' study. It provides new insights into the latent dynamics of
the implied volatility surface. We also incorporate Heston stochastic
volatility into the moneyness scaling method for better tractability of the
model.

quantitative research to support better investment decisions, yet there are
several challenges often overlooked in practice. (1) ML code tends to be
unstructured and ad hoc, which hinders cooperation with others. (2) Resource
requirements and dependencies vary depending on which algorithm is used, so a
flexible and scalable system is needed. (3) It is difficult for domain experts
in traditional finance to apply their experience and knowledge in ML-based
strategies unless they acquire expertise in recent technologies. This paper
presents Shai-am, an ML platform integrated with our own Python framework. The
platform leverages existing modern open-source technologies, managing
containerized pipelines for ML-based strategies with unified interfaces to
solve the aforementioned issues. Each strategy implements the interface defined
in the core framework. The framework is designed to enhance reusability and
readability, facilitating collaborative work in quantitative research. Shai-am
aims to be a pure AI asset manager for solving various tasks in financial

used in a variety of applications such as robotics, game playing, and
autonomous systems. In recent years, there has been growing interest in
applying RL to quantitative trading, where the goal is to make profitable
trades in financial markets. This paper explores the use of RL in quantitative
trading and presents a case study of a RL-based trading algorithm. The results
show that RL can be a powerful tool for quantitative trading, and that it has
the potential to outperform traditional trading algorithms. The use of
reinforcement learning in quantitative trading represents a promising area of
research that can potentially lead to the development of more sophisticated and
effective trading systems. Future work could explore the use of alternative
reinforcement learning algorithms, incorporate additional data sources, and
test the system on different asset classes. Overall, our research demonstrates
the potential of using reinforcement learning in quantitative trading and
highlights the importance of continued research and development in this area.

  Insights from a Multi-Agent Simulation Study","  Exploring complex adaptive financial trading environments through multi-agent
based simulation methods presents an innovative approach within the realm of
quantitative finance. Despite the dominance of multi-agent reinforcement
learning approaches in financial markets with observable data, there exists a
set of systematically significant financial markets that pose challenges due to
their partial or obscured data availability. We, therefore, devise a
multi-agent simulation approach employing small-scale meta-heuristic methods.
This approach aims to represent the opaque bilateral market for Australian
government bond trading, capturing the bilateral nature of bank-to-bank
trading, also referred to as ""over-the-counter"" (OTC) trading, and commonly
occurring between ""market makers"". The uniqueness of the bilateral market,
characterized by negotiated transactions and a limited number of agents, yields
valuable insights for agent-based modelling and quantitative finance. The
inherent rigidity of this market structure, which is at odds with the global
proliferation of multilateral platforms and the decentralization of finance,
underscores the unique insights offered by our agent-based model. We explore
the implications of market rigidity on market structure and consider the
element of stability, in market design. This extends the ongoing discourse on
complex financial trading environments, providing an enhanced understanding of
their dynamics and implications.

these tasks evaluate a model's financial background knowledge, ability to parse
financial documents, and capacity to solve problems with code. We conduct an
in-depth evaluation of open-source and commercial LLMs, comparing and
contrasting the behavior of code-focused and language-focused models. We
demonstrate that the current bottleneck in performance is due to LLMs' limited
business and financial understanding, highlighting the value of a challenging

postprocessing quantitative strategies so as to increase the Sharpe ratio and
reduce trading risks. The signal from this procedure is an indicator of trading
or not on a daily basis. Finally, we analyze this procedure on SH510300 and
SH510050 assets. The strategies are evaluated by measurements of Sharpe ratio,
max drawdown, and Calmar ratio. However, there is always a risk of loss in
trading. The results from the tests are just examples of how the method works;
no claim is made on the suggestion of real market positions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0008103v1,Power-laws in economy and finance: some ideas from physics,"  We discuss several models in order to shed light on the origin of power-law
distributions and power-law correlations in financial time series. From an
empirical point of view, the exponents describing the tails of the price
increments distribution and the decay of the volatility correlations are rather
robust and suggest universality. However, many of the models that appear
naturally (for example, to account for the distribution of wealth) contain some
multiplicative noise, which generically leads to *non universal exponents*.
Recent progress in the empirical study of the volatility suggests that the
volatility results from some sort of multiplicative cascade. A convincing
`microscopic' (i.e. trader based) model that explains this observation is
however not yet available. It would be particularly important to understand the
relevance of the pseudo-geometric progression of natural human time scales on
the long range nature of the volatility correlations.

significant questions for large time lags -- 40 to 250 days -- where the

In this letter, we show a direct comparison between high energy physics and

The gap is defined as the number of consecutive positive returns after a
negative return, thus this is a gap in negative return. Inversely for a gap in

overcome this difficulty, we rewrite this quantity as solution of a

an error analysis. Errors bounds have been derived and the study relies more on
smoothness properties which are not provided by the payoff? functions, but
rather by the density function of the underlying stochastic models. This is
particularly relevant for options pricing where the payoff of the contract are
generally not smooth functions. The numerical experiments on a class of models

  (DeFi)","  In recent years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has experienced remarkable
growth, with various protocols such as lending protocols and automated market
makers (AMMs) emerging. Traditionally, these protocols employ off-chain
governance, where token holders vote to modify parameters. However, manual
parameter adjustment, often conducted by the protocol's core team, is
vulnerable to collusion, compromising the integrity and security of the system.
Furthermore, purely deterministic, algorithm-based approaches may expose the
protocol to novel exploits and attacks.
  In this paper, we present ""Auto.gov"", a learning-based on-chain governance
framework for DeFi that enhances security and reduces susceptibility to
attacks. Our model leverages a deep Q- network (DQN) reinforcement learning
approach to propose semi-automated, intuitive governance proposals with
quantitative justifications. This methodology enables the system to efficiently
adapt to and mitigate the negative impact of malicious behaviors, such as price
oracle attacks, more effectively than benchmark models. Our evaluation
demonstrates that Auto.gov offers a more reactive, objective, efficient, and
resilient solution compared to existing manual processes, thereby significantly
bolstering the security and, ultimately, enhancing the profitability of DeFi
protocols.

nonlinear in nature and enjoy quantitative error estimates based on the notion
of discrepancy error, which allows one to evaluate the relevance and accuracy

mathematically establish FourNet's capacity to approximate transition densities

parameters of FourNet are learned by minimizing a loss function derived from
the known characteristic function and the Fourier transform of the FFNN,
complemented by a strategic sampling approach to enhance training. We derive
practical bounds for the $L_2$ estimation error and the potential pointwise
loss of nonnegativity in FourNet, highlighting its robustness and applicability
in practical settings. FourNet's accuracy and versatility are demonstrated
through a wide range of dynamics common in quantitative finance, including

makers (AMMs) play a key role: they provide a market place for trading assets
in a decentralized manner. For so-called bluechip pairs, arbitrage activity
provides a major part of the revenue generation of AMMs but also a major source
of loss due to the so-called 'informed orderflow'. Finding ways to minimize
those losses while still keeping uninformed trading activity alive is a major
problem in the field. In this paper we will investigate the mechanics of said
arbitrage and try to understand how AMMs can maximize the revenue creation or
in other words minimize the losses. To that end, we model the dynamics of
arbitrage activity for a concrete implementation of a pool and study its
sensitivity to the choice of fee aiming to maximize the revenue for the AMM. We
identify dynamical fees that mimic the directionality of the price due to
asymmetric fee choices as a promising avenue to mitigate losses to toxic flow.

nonextensive Tsallis statistics to construct all considered data in order to

how one can make a clear quantitative distinction for any real data between
true multifractality caused by the presence of nonlinear correlations, spurious
multifractality generated by fat-tailed shape of distributions - eventually
with their asymmetry, and the correction due to linear autocorrelations in

already over a decade. The decisions are made without human intervention using
the data provided by brokerage firms and exchanges. There is an emerging
intermediate layer of financial players that are placed in between a broker and
algorithmic traders. The role of these players is to aggregate market decisions
from the algorithmic traders and send a final market order to a broker. In
return, the quantitative analysts receive incentives proportional to the
correctness of their predictions. In such a setup, the intermediate player - an
aggregator - does not provide the market data in plaintext but encrypts it.
Encrypting market data prevents quantitative analysts from trading on their
own, as well as keeps valuable financial data private. This paper proposes an
implementation of a popular trend-following indicator with two different
homomorphic encryption libraries - SEAL and HEAAN - and compares it to the
trading indicator implemented for plaintext. Then an attempt to implement a
trading strategy is presented and analysed. The trading indicator implemented
with SEAL and HEAAN is almost identical to that implemented on the plaintext,
the percentage error is of 0.14916% and 0.00020% respectively. Despite many
limitations that homomorphic encryption imposes on this algorithm's

generates interpretable rationales. To generate accurate and faithful

trading (QT). Despite great research efforts devoted to leveraging deep
learning (DL) methods for building better QT strategies, existing studies still
face serious challenges especially from the side of finance, such as the
balance of risk and return, the resistance to extreme loss, and the
interpretability of strategies, which limit the application of DL-based
strategies in real-life financial markets. In this work, we propose AlphaStock,
a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based investment strategy enhanced by
interpretable deep attention networks, to address the above challenges. Our
main contributions are summarized as follows: i) We integrate deep attention
networks with a Sharpe ratio-oriented reinforcement learning framework to
achieve a risk-return balanced investment strategy; ii) We suggest modeling
interrelationships among assets to avoid selection bias and develop a
cross-asset attention mechanism; iii) To our best knowledge, this work is among
the first to offer an interpretable investment strategy using deep
reinforcement learning models. The experiments on long-periodic U.S. and
Chinese markets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of AlphaStock over
diverse market states. It turns out that AlphaStock tends to select the stocks
as winners with high long-term growth, low volatility, high intrinsic value,

  improve portfolio risk modelling","  One of the most challenging aspects in the analysis and modelling of
financial markets, including Credit Default Swap (CDS) markets, is the presence
of an emergent, intermediate level of structure standing in between the
microscopic dynamics of individual financial entities and the macroscopic
dynamics of the market as a whole. This elusive, mesoscopic level of
organisation is often sought for via factor models that ultimately decompose
the market according to geographic regions and economic industries. However, at
a more general level the presence of mesoscopic structure might be revealed in
an entirely data-driven approach, looking for a modular and possibly
hierarchical organisation of the empirical correlation matrix between financial
time series. The crucial ingredient in such an approach is the definition of an
appropriate null model for the correlation matrix. Recent research showed that
community detection techniques developed for networks become intrinsically
biased when applied to correlation matrices. For this reason, a method based on
Random Matrix Theory has been developed, which identifies the optimal
hierarchical decomposition of the system into internally correlated and
mutually anti-correlated communities. Building upon this technique, here we
resolve the mesoscopic structure of the CDS market and identify groups of
issuers that cannot be traced back to standard industry/region taxonomies,
thereby being inaccessible to standard factor models. We use this decomposition
to introduce a novel default risk model that is shown to outperform more
traditional alternatives.

to presence of autocorrelation in the returns of the traded assets, the SR as a
function of the portfolio formation period (look-back) is very different from
performance due to the drift (average return). The SR shows that for look-back
periods of a few months the investor is more likely to tap into
autocorrelation. However, for look-back larger than few months, the drift of
the asset becomes progressively more important. Finally, our empirical work
reports a new long-term effect, namely oscillation of the SR and propose a
non-stationary model to account for such oscillations.

there exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a

visualization of quantitative and qualitative data (and, especially
multivariate data) is an extremely important topic. Data visualization

the program sketch to tune a trained DRL policy according to the different

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01219v3,Weak error rates for option pricing under linear rough volatility,"  In quantitative finance, modeling the volatility structure of underlying
assets is vital to pricing options. Rough stochastic volatility models, such as
the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral, Quantitative Finance 16(6),
887-904, 2016], seek to fit observed market data based on the observation that
the log-realized variance behaves like a fractional Brownian motion with small
Hurst parameter, $H < 1/2$, over reasonable timescales. Both time series of
asset prices and option-derived price data indicate that $H$ often takes values
close to $0.1$ or less, i.e., rougher than Brownian motion. This change
improves the fit to both option prices and time series of underlying asset
prices while maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of
the driving fractional Brownian motion in rough volatility models poses severe
challenges for theoretical and numerical analyses and for computational
practice. While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution
of the rough Bergomi and similar models, its strong rate of convergence is only
$H$. We prove rate $H + 1/2$ for the weak convergence of the Euler method for
the rough Stein-Stein model, which treats the volatility as a linear function
of the driving fractional Brownian motion, and, surprisingly, we prove rate one
for the case of quadratic payoff functions. Our proof uses Talay-Tubaro
expansions and an affine Markovian representation of the underlying and is
further supported by numerical experiments. These convergence results provide a
first step toward deriving weak rates for the rough Bergomi model, which treats
the volatility as a nonlinear function of the driving fractional Brownian
motion.

  market-order flow?: a quantitative test of the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model","  In financial markets, the market order sign exhibits strong persistence,
widely known as the long-range correlation (LRC) of order flow; specifically,
the sign correlation function displays long memory with power-law exponent
$\gamma$, such that $C(\tau) \propto \tau^{-\gamma}$ for large time-lag $\tau$.
One of the most promising microscopic hypotheses is the order-splitting
behaviour at the level of individual traders. Indeed, Lillo, Mike, and Farmer

behaviour, which predicts that the macroscopic sign correlation is
quantitatively associated with the microscopic distribution of metaorders.
While this hypothesis has been a central issue of debate in econophysics, its
direct quantitative validation has been missing because it requires large
microscopic datasets with high resolution to observe the order-splitting
behaviour of all individual traders. Here we present the first quantitative
validation of this LFM prediction by analysing a large microscopic dataset in
the Tokyo Stock Exchange market for more than nine years. On classifying all
traders as either order-splitting traders or random traders as a statistical
clustering, we directly measured the metaorder-length distributions
$P(L)\propto L^{-\alpha-1}$ as the microscopic parameter of the LMF model and
examined the theoretical prediction on the macroscopic order correlation:
$\gamma \approx \alpha - 1$. We discover that the LMF prediction agrees with
the actual data even at the quantitative level. Our work provides the first
solid support of the microscopic model and solves directly a long-standing

splitting is a trading strategy to execute their large potential metaorder into
small pieces to reduce transaction cost. This strategic behavior is believed to
be important because it is a promising candidate for the microscopic origin of
the long-range correlation (LRC) in the persistent order flow. Indeed, in 2005,
Lillo, Mike, and Farmer (LMF) introduced a microscopic model of the
order-splitting traders to predict the asymptotic behavior of the LRC from the
microscopic dynamics, even quantitatively. The plausibility of this scenario
has been qualitatively investigated by Toth et al. 2015. However, no solid
support has been presented yet on the quantitative prediction by the LMF model
in the lack of large microscopic datasets. In this report, we have provided the
first quantitative statistical analysis of the order-splitting behavior at the
level of each trading account. We analyse a large dataset of the Tokyo stock
exchange (TSE) market over nine years, including the account data of traders
(called virtual servers). The virtual server is a unit of trading accounts in
the TSE market, and we can effectively define the trader IDs by an appropriate
preprocessing. We apply a strategy clustering to individual traders to identify
the order-splitting traders and the random traders. For most of the stocks, we
find that the metaorder length distribution obeys power laws with exponent
$\alpha$, such that $P(L)\propto L^{-\alpha-1}$ with the metaorder length $L$.
By analysing the sign correlation $C(\tau)\propto \tau^{-\gamma}$, we directly
confirmed the LMF prediction $\gamma \approx \alpha-1$. Furthermore, we discuss
how to estimate the total number of the splitting traders only from public data
via the ACF prefactor formula in the LMF model. Our work provides the first
quantitative evidence of the LMF model.

learning have reported biased parameter estimates at low SNR. Such systematic
errors arise from the choice of Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function for
network training, which is incompatible with Rician-distributed MR magnitude
signals. To address this issue, we introduce the negative log Rician likelihood
(NLR) loss. Methods: A numerically stable and accurate implementation of the
NLR loss was developed to estimate quantitative parameters of the apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC) model and intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM)
model. Parameter estimation accuracy, precision and overall error were
evaluated in terms of bias, variance and root mean squared error and compared
against the MSE loss over a range of SNRs (5 - 30). Results: Networks trained
with NLR loss show higher estimation accuracy than MSE for the ADC and IVIM
diffusion coefficients as SNR decreases, with minimal loss of precision or
total error. At high effective SNR (high SNR and small diffusion coefficients),
both losses show comparable accuracy and precision for all parameters of both
models. Conclusion: The proposed NLR loss is numerically stable and accurate
across the full range of tested SNRs and improves parameter estimation accuracy
of diffusion coefficients using self-supervised deep learning. We expect the

  in Quantitative Finance","  As deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been recognized as an effective
approach in quantitative finance, getting hands-on experiences is attractive to
beginners. However, to train a practical DRL trading agent that decides where
to trade, at what price, and what quantity involves error-prone and arduous
development and debugging. In this paper, we introduce a DRL library FinRL that
facilitates beginners to expose themselves to quantitative finance and to
develop their own stock trading strategies. Along with easily-reproducible
tutorials, FinRL library allows users to streamline their own developments and
to compare with existing schemes easily. Within FinRL, virtual environments are
configured with stock market datasets, trading agents are trained with neural
networks, and extensive backtesting is analyzed via trading performance.
Moreover, it incorporates important trading constraints such as transaction
cost, market liquidity and the investor's degree of risk-aversion. FinRL is
featured with completeness, hands-on tutorial and reproducibility that favors
beginners: (i) at multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simulates trading
environments across various stock markets, including NASDAQ-100, DJIA, S&P 500,
HSI, SSE 50, and CSI 300; (ii) organized in a layered architecture with modular
structure, FinRL provides fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms (DQN,
DDPG, PPO, SAC, A2C, TD3, etc.), commonly-used reward functions and standard
evaluation baselines to alleviate the debugging workloads and promote the
reproducibility, and (iii) being highly extendable, FinRL reserves a complete
set of user-import interfaces. Furthermore, we incorporated three application
demonstrations, namely single stock trading, multiple stock trading, and
portfolio allocation. The FinRL library will be available on Github at link

abstracting away from fast reactions as suggested by the Quasi-Steady-State

congruence under an appropriate condition for the cooperation operator of
Bio-PEPA. The condition requires that there is no synchronisation over fast

We also show congruence for an operator which extends the reactions available
for a species. We characterise models for which it is only necessary to
consider the matching of slow transitions and we illustrate the equivalence on
two models of competitive inhibition.

  Chapter 1: By analogy with energy, the equilibrium probability distribution
of money must follow the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs law characterized by an
effective temperature equal to the average amount of money per economic agent.
A thermal machine which extracts a monetary profit can be constructed between
two economic systems with different temperatures.
  Chapter 2: Using data from several sources, it is found that the distribution
of income is described for the great majority of population by an exponential
distribution, whereas the high-end tail follows a power law. The Lorenz curve
and Gini coefficient were calculated and are shown to be in good agreement with
both income and wealth data sets.
  Chapter 3: The Heston model where stock-price dynamics is governed by a
geometrical (multiplicative) Brownian motion with stochastic variance is
studied. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is solved exactly.
Integrating out the variance, an analytic formula for the time-dependent
probability distribution of stock price changes (returns) is found. The formula
is in excellent agreement with the Dow-Jones index for the time lags from 1 to

http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5350v1,A Quantum-like Approach to the Stock Market,"  Modern approaches to stock pricing in quantitative finance are typically
founded on the 'Black-Scholes model' and the underlying 'random walk
hypothesis'. Empirical data indicate that this hypothesis works well in stable
situations but, in abrupt transitions such as during an economical crisis, the
random walk model fails and alternative descriptions are needed. For this
reason, several proposals have been recently forwarded which are based on the
formalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper we apply the 'SCoP formalism',
elaborated to provide an operational foundation of quantum mechanics, to the
stock market. We argue that a stock market is an intrinsically contextual
system where agents' decisions globally influence the market system and stocks
prices, determining a nonclassical behavior. More specifically, we maintain
that a given stock does not generally have a definite value, e.g., a price, but
its value is actualized as a consequence of the contextual interactions in the
trading process. This contextual influence is responsible of the
non-Kolmogorovian quantum-like behavior of the market at a statistical level.
Then, we propose a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement formalism'
that describes a buying/selling process of a stock and shows that it is
intuitively reasonable to assume that the stock has not a definite price until
it is traded. This result is relevant in our opinion since it provides a
theoretical support to the use of quantum models in finance.

distribution of the investors according to their psychological profiles and the
rate of return distribution. Moreover, we analyze the influence of changing the
psychological profile of the hub of the network and report interesting results
which show how and when anti-imitation becomes the most profitable strategy for
investment. Besides this, an intriguing asymmetry of the return rate
distribution is explained considering the behavioral aspect of the investors.
This asymmetry is quite robust being observed even when a completely different
algorithm to calculate the decision making of the investors was applied to it,

co-integrates with the market principal factor, while the short term one
captures transient swings of the market associated with the idiosyncratic
components and captures the correlation structure of returns. Using quantile
regressions, we assess the significance of the contemporaneous and lagged
explanatory power of sentiment on returns finding strong statistical evidence

information it can hold. In mathematics we can model more general relational
data in a graph structure while retaining Euclidean data as associated node or
edge features. Due to the ubiquity of graph data, and its ability to hold
multiple dimensions of information, graph deep learning has become a fast
emerging field. We look at applying and optimising graph deep learning on a
finance graph to produce more informed clusters of companies. Having clusters
produced from multiple streams of data can be highly useful in quantitative
finance; not only does it allow clusters to be tailored to the specific task
but the culmination of multiple streams allows for cross source pattern
recognition that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. This can provide
financial institutions with an edge over competitors which is crucial in the
heavily optimised world of trading. In this paper we use news co-occurrence and
stock price for our data combination. We optimise our model to achieve an
average testing precision of 78% and find a clear improvement in clustering
capabilities when dual data sources are used; cluster purity rises from 32% for
just vertex data and 42% for just edge data to 64% when both are used in

efficient to incrementally update the forecast model with the latest data which
may reveal some new patterns recurring in the future stock market. However,
incremental learning for stock trend forecasting still remains under-explored
due to the challenge of distribution shifts (a.k.a. concept drifts). With the

or significantly differ from incremental data, hindering the effectiveness of
incremental updates. To address this challenge, we propose DoubleAdapt, an
end-to-end framework with two adapters, which can effectively adapt the data
and the model to mitigate the effects of distribution shifts. Our key insight
is to automatically learn how to adapt stock data into a locally stationary
distribution in favor of profitable updates. Complemented by data adaptation,
we can confidently adapt the model parameters under mitigated distribution
shifts. We cast each incremental learning task as a meta-learning task and
automatically optimize the adapters for desirable data adaptation and parameter

DoubleAdapt achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance and shows

practice, a set of formulaic alphas is often used together for better modeling
precision, so we need to find synergistic formulaic alpha sets that work well

separately, overlooking the fact that the alphas would be combined later. In
this paper, we propose a new alpha-mining framework that prioritizes mining a
synergistic set of alphas, i.e., it directly uses the performance of the
downstream combination model to optimize the alpha generator. Our framework
also leverages the strong exploratory capabilities of reinforcement
learning~(RL) to better explore the vast search space of formulaic alphas. The
contribution to the combination models' performance is assigned to be the
return used in the RL process, driving the alpha generator to find better
alphas that improve upon the current set. Experimental evaluations on

determined: the number of equations is one less than the number of unknowns, so
only relative prices are determined. In the language of mathematics, the
equations are ``homogeneous of order one''. Using the language of physics, this
represents a continuous ``Goldstone'' symmetry. However, the continuous
symmetry is often broken by the dynamics of the system, thus fixing the value
of the otherwise undetermined variable. In economics, the value of money is a
strategic variable which each agent must determine at each transaction by
estimating the effect of future interactions with other agents. This idea is
illustrated by a simple network model of monopolistic vendors and buyers, with
bounded rationality. We submit that dynamical, spontaneous symmetry breaking is
the fundamental principle for fixing the value of money. Perhaps the continuous
symmetry representing the lack of restoring force is also the fundamental
reason for large fluctuations in stock markets.

arbitrary monotonous change of variable, we investigate the null hypothesis
that the dependence between financial assets can be modeled by the Gaussian
copula. We find that most pairs of currencies and pairs of major stocks are
compatible with the Gaussian copula hypothesis, while this hypothesis can be
rejected for the dependence between pairs of commodities (metals).
Notwithstanding the apparent qualification of the Gaussian copula hypothesis
for most of the currencies and the stocks, a non-Gaussian copula, such as the
Student's copula, cannot be rejected if it has sufficiently many ``degrees of
freedom''. As a consequence, it may be very dangerous to embrace blindly the

foreign currency exchange rates. Our approach is based on queueing theory,
particularly, the so-called renewal-reward theorem. For the first passage
processes of the Sony Bank US dollar/Japanese yen (USD/JPY) exchange rate, we
evaluate the average waiting time which is defined as the average time that
customers have to wait between any instant when they want to observe the rate
(e.g. when they log in to their computer systems) and the next rate change. We
find that the assumption of exponential distribution for the first-passage
process should be rejected and that a Weibull distribution seems more suitable
for explaining the stochastic process of the Sony Bank rate. Our approach also
enables us to evaluate the expected reward for customers, i.e. one can predict
how long customers must wait and how much reward they will obtain by the next
price change after they log in to their computer systems. We check the validity
of our prediction by comparing it with empirical data analysis.

the nature of stochastic processes that underlie market dynamics. One aspect of
the solution to this problem involves determining characteristics of the
distribution of fluctuations in returns. Empirical studies conducted over the
last decade have reported that they arenon-Gaussian, scale in time, and have
power-law(or fat) tails. However, because they use sliding interval methods of
analysis, these studies implicitly assume that the underlying process has
stationary increments. We explicitly show that this assumption is not valid for
the Euro-Dollar exchange rate between 1999-2004. In addition, we find that
fluctuations in returns of the exchange rate are uncorrelated and scale as
power-laws for certain time intervals during each day. This behavior is
consistent with a diffusive process with a diffusion coefficient that depends
both on the time and the price change. Within scaling regions, we find that
sliding interval methods can generate fat-tailed distributions as an artifact,
and that the type of scaling reported in many previous studies does not exist.

finance to ecology. It means that the variance and the mean of a specific
quantity are related as $\ev{\sigma^2|n}\propto \ev{n|A}^{2\alpha}$ with
$1/2\geq \alpha \geq 1$ when a parameter $A$ (usually the system size) is
varied. $A$ can be the strength of the node, the capitalization of the firm or
the area of the habitat. On the other hand, quantities often obey gap scaling
meaning that their density function depends on, say, the system size $A$ as
$P(n|A) = n^{-1}F(n/A^{\Phi})$. This note describes that these two notions
cannot coexist except when $\alpha = 1$. In this way one can empirically
exclude the possibility of gap scaling in many complex systems including
population dynamics, stock market fluctuations and Internet router traffic,

introduced, as one of the listed products, options on its implied volatility
index (VIX). This created the challenge of developing a pricing framework that
can simultaneously handle European options, forward-starts, options on the
realized variance and options on the VIX. In this paper we propose a new
approach to this problem using spectral methods. We use a regime switching
model with jumps and local volatility defined in \cite{FXrev} and calibrate it
to the European options on the S&P 500 for a broad range of strikes and
maturities. The main idea of this paper is to ""lift"" (i.e. extend) the
generator of the underlying process to keep track of the relevant path
information, namely the realized variance. The lifted generator is too large a
matrix to be diagonalized numerically. We overcome this difficulty by applying
a new semi-analytic algorithm for block-diagonalization. This method enables us
to evaluate numerically the joint distribution between the underlying stock
price and the realized variance, which in turn gives us a way of pricing
consistently European options, general accrued variance payoffs and
forward-starting and VIX options.

small. For uncorrelated particle production within $\Delta$, Gaussian
statistics holds and factorial moments $F_q$ are equal to unity for all orders
$q$. Correlations between particles lead to a broadening of the multiplicity
distribution and to dynamical fluctuations. In this case, the factorial moments
increase above 1 with decreasing $\Delta$. This corresponds to what can be
called intermittency. In this letter, we show that a similar analysis can be
developed on financial price series, with an adequate definition of factorial
moments. An intermittent behavior can be extracted using moments of order 2
($F_2$), illustrating a sensitivity to non-Gaussian fluctuations within time
resolution below 4 hours. This confirms that correlations between price returns

question of the smoothness of the volatility process. Our main result is that
log-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst
exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable time scale. This leads us to adopt
the fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault. We call
our model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H<1/2. We
demonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time
series data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts
of realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not
long memory in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at
detecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory
in data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility
has been widely accepted as a stylized fact. Finally, we provide a quantitative

are respectively important features of the spatial and temporal correlations.
However, the microscopic generation mechanism of the sector structure is not
yet understood. Especially, how to produce these two features in one model
remains challenging. We introduce a novel interaction mechanism, i.e., the
multi-level herding, in constructing an agent-based model to investigate the
sector structure combined with volatility clustering. According to the previous
market performance, agents trade in groups, and their herding behavior
comprises the herding at stock, sector and market levels. Further, we propose
methods to determine the key model parameters from historical market data,
rather than from statistical fitting of the results. From the simulation, we
obtain the sector structure and volatility clustering, as well as the
eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, for the New York and
Hong Kong stock exchanges. These properties are in agreement with the empirical
ones. Our results quantitatively reveal that the multi-level herding is the
microscopic generation mechanism of the sector structure, and provide new
insight into the spatio-temporal interactions in financial systems at the
microscopic level.

employ an alternative version of stochastic algorithms with projection (see

we formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem, derive its dual
formulation, and solve it numerically via an augmented Lagrangian method and
the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The solution
effectively reconstructs the dynamic of the asset price between the two dates
by recovering the optimal local volatility function, without requiring any time
interpolation of the option prices.

approaches the integral harmonic mean of the local volatility with respect to
log-strike, see [Berestycki et al., Asymptotics and calibration of local
volatility models, Quantitative Finance, 2, 2002]. This paper is dedicated to a
complementary model-free result: an arbitrage-free implied volatility in fact
is the harmonic mean of a positive function for any fixed maturity. We
investigate the latter function, which is tightly linked to Fukasawa's
invertible map $f_{1/2}$ [Fukasawa, The normalizing transformation of the
implied volatility smile, Mathematical Finance, 22, 2012], and its relation
with the local volatility surface. It turns out that the log-strike
transformation $z = f_{1/2}(k)$ defines a new coordinate system in which the
short-dated implied volatility approaches the arithmetic (as opposed to

This forward-looking measure gauges the sentiment on the future volatility of

Consequently, in this paper we investigate Google News statistics and Wikipedia

preliminary evidence of non-linear relationships between features obtained from

into price models. We consider that there are several types of agents trading
only in specific multiples of the tick size resulting in an increased
occurrence of these multiples in prices. For example, stocks on the NYSE and
NASDAQ exchanges are traded with precision to one cent but multiples of five
cents and ten cents occur much more often in prices. To capture this behavior,
we propose a discrete price model based on a mixture of double Poisson
distributions with dynamic volatility and dynamic proportions of agent types.
The model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method. In an empirical study

price clustering at the ultra-high frequency. This is in sharp contrast with
results at low frequencies which show that daily realized volatility has a

finance community in recent years. In this paradigm, the volatility of the
asset price is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with a small value for
the Hurst parameter $H$. In this work, we provide a rigorous statistical
analysis of these models. To do so, we establish minimax lower bounds for
parameter estimation and design procedures based on wavelets attaining them. We
notably obtain an optimal speed of convergence of $n^{-1/(4H+2)}$ for
estimating $H$ based on n sampled data, extending results known only for the
easier case $H>1/2$ so far. We therefore establish that the parameters of rough
volatility models can be inferred with optimal accuracy in all regimes.

examples of which include the rough Bergomi and rough Stein-Stein model, that
have gained considerable importance in quantitative finance.
  A basic question for such (non-Markovian) models concerns efficient numerical
schemes. While strong rates are well understood (order $H$), we tackle here the
intricate question of weak rates. Our main result asserts that the weak rate,
for a reasonably large class of test function, is essentially of order $\min \{
3H+\tfrac12, 1 \}$ where $H \in (0,1/2]$ is the Hurst parameter of the
fractional Brownian motion that underlies the rough volatility process.
  Interestingly, the phase transition at $H=1/6$ is related to the correlation
between the two driving factors, and thus gives additional meaning to a
quantity already of central importance in stochastic volatility modelling.Our
results are complemented by a lower bound which show that the obtained weak
rate is indeed optimal.

to show that the Advantage 4.1 can sample classical Boltzmann random variables
to some extent, but is limited in its ability to sample from quantum Boltzmann

are much noisier than those trained using simulations and struggle to perform
at the same level as classical RBMs. However, there is the potential for QBMs
to outperform classical RBMs if future generation annealers can generate
samples closer to the desired theoretical distributions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00426v1,"Fisher's combined probability test for high-dimensional covariance
  matrices","  Testing large covariance matrices is of fundamental importance in statistical
analysis with high-dimensional data. In the past decade, three types of test
statistics have been studied in the literature: quadratic form statistics,
maximum form statistics, and their weighted combination. It is known that
quadratic form statistics would suffer from low power against sparse
alternatives and maximum form statistics would suffer from low power against
dense alternatives. The weighted combination methods were introduced to enhance
the power of quadratic form statistics or maximum form statistics when the
weights are appropriately chosen. In this paper, we provide a new perspective
to exploit the full potential of quadratic form statistics and maximum form
statistics for testing high-dimensional covariance matrices. We propose a
scale-invariant power enhancement test based on Fisher's method to combine the
p-values of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics. After
carefully studying the asymptotic joint distribution of quadratic form
statistics and maximum form statistics, we prove that the proposed combination
method retains the correct asymptotic size and boosts the power against more
general alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate the finite-sample performance in
simulation studies and a real application.

model spaces. An important tool to study these structures are Pseudo-Riemannian
metrices, which in the category of statistical models are induced by
statistical divergences. The present article extends the notation of
topological statistical models by a differential structure to statistical
manifolds and introduces the differential geometric foundations to study

asymptotically standard normal with error of order $n^{-1}$, where $n$ is the

is the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter $\theta$ of the model and
$a$ is an ancillary statistic. This condition is very difficult or impossible
to verify for many models. However, calculation of the statistics themselves
does not require this condition. The goal of this paper is to provide
conditions under which these statistics are asymptotically normally distributed
to order $n^{-1}$ without making any assumption about the sufficient statistic

http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4019v1,Fuzzy Statistical Limits,"  Statistical limits are defined relaxing conditions on conventional
convergence. The main idea of the statistical convergence of a sequence l is
that the majority of elements from l converge and we do not care what is going
on with other elements. At the same time, it is known that sequences that come
from real life sources, such as measurement and computation, do not allow, in a
general case, to test whether they converge or statistically converge in the
strict mathematical sense. To overcome these limitations, fuzzy convergence was
introduced earlier in the context of neoclassical analysis and fuzzy
statistical convergence is introduced and studied in this paper. We find
relations between fuzzy statistical convergence of a sequence and fuzzy
statistical convergence of its subsequences (Theorem 2.1), as well as between
fuzzy statistical convergence of a sequence and conventional convergence of its
subsequences (Theorem 2.2). It is demonstrated what operations with fuzzy
statistical limits are induced by operations on sequences (Theorem 2.3) and how
fuzzy statistical limits of different sequences influence one another (Theorem
2.4). In Section 3, relations between fuzzy statistical convergence and fuzzy
convergence of statistical characteristics, such as the mean (average) and
standard deviation, are studied (Theorems 3.1 and 3.2).

check for a significantly large proportion of cases within some scanning

value over all windows, whereas the average likelihood ratio (ALR) test
statistic that we consider here takes an average of the GLR values. Numerical
experiments in the literature and in this paper show that the ALR test
statistic has more power compared to the spatial scan statistic. We develop in
this paper accurate tail probability approximations of the ALR test statistic
that allow us to by-pass computer intensive Monte Carlo procedures to estimate

require an initial fitting of parameters that can result in very biased

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08647v1,"Multi-Statistic Approximate Bayesian Computation with Multi-Armed
  Bandits","  Approximate Bayesian computation is an established and popular method for
likelihood-free inference with applications in many disciplines. The
effectiveness of the method depends critically on the availability of well
performing summary statistics. Summary statistic selection relies heavily on
domain knowledge and carefully engineered features, and can be a laborious time
consuming process. Since the method is sensitive to data dimensionality, the
process of selecting summary statistics must balance the need to include
informative statistics and the dimensionality of the feature vector. This paper
proposes to treat the problem of dynamically selecting an appropriate summary
statistic from a given pool of candidate summary statistics as a multi-armed
bandit problem. This allows approximate Bayesian computation rejection sampling
to dynamically focus on a distribution over well performing summary statistics
as opposed to a fixed set of statistics. The proposed method is unique in that
it does not require any pre-processing and is scalable to a large number of
candidate statistics. This enables efficient use of a large library of possible
time series summary statistics without prior feature engineering. The proposed
approach is compared to state-of-the-art methods for summary statistics
selection using a challenging test problem from the systems biology literature.

projected 2D matter density fields from the Quijote N-body simulations of the
large-scale structure of the Universe. By computing Fisher information
matrices, we find that the WPH statistics place more stringent constraints on
four of five cosmological parameters when compared to statistics based on the
combination of the power spectrum and bispectrum. We also use the WPH
statistics with a maximum entropy model to statistically generate new 2D
density fields that accurately reproduce the probability density function, the
mean and standard deviation of the power spectrum, the bispectrum, and
Minkowski functionals of the input density fields. Although other methods are
efficient for either parameter estimates or statistical syntheses of the
large-scale structure, WPH statistics are the first statistics that achieve
state-of-the-art results for both tasks as well as being interpretable.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08835v1,Inclusion statistics and particle condensation in 2 dimensions,"  We propose a new type of quantum statistics, which we call inclusion
statistics, in which particles tend to coalesce more than ordinary bosons.
Inclusion statistics is defined in analogy with exclusion statistics, in which
statistical exclusion is stronger than in Fermi statistics, but now
extrapolating beyond Bose statistics, resulting in statistical inclusion. A
consequence of inclusion statistics is that the lowest space dimension in which
particles can condense in the absence of potentials is $d=2$, unlike $d=3$ for
the usual Bose-Einstein condensation. This reduction in the dimension happens
for any inclusion stronger than bosons, and the critical temperature increases
with stronger inclusion. Possible physical realizations of inclusion statistics
involving attractive interactions between bosons may be experimentally
achievable.

history and play a fundamental role in statistics, machine learning and
associated scientific disciplines. However, within the statistical literature,
this extensive role has too often been played out behind the scenes, with other
aspects of the statistical problems being viewed as more central, more
interesting, or more important. The behind the scenes role of statistical
distances shows up in estimation, where we often use estimators based on
minimizing a distance, explicitly or implicitly, but rarely studying how the
properties of a distance determine the properties of the estimators. Distances
are also prominent in goodness-of-fit, but the usual question we ask is ""how
powerful is this method against a set of interesting alternatives"" not ""what
aspect of the distance between the hypothetical model and the alternative are
we measuring?""
  Our focus is on describing the statistical properties of some of the distance
measures we have found to be most important and most visible. We illustrate the
robust nature of Neyman's chi-squared and the non-robust nature of Pearson's
chi-squared statistics and discuss the concept of discretization robustness.

the similar spirit to the Wigner surmise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
singular values of open quantum many-body systems follow the random-matrix

http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2273v1,Measures of uncertainty in market network analysis,"  Statistical uncertainty of different filtration techniques for market network
analysis is studied. Two measures of statistical uncertainty are discussed. One
is based on conditional risk for multiple decision statistical procedures and
another one is based on average fraction of errors. It is shown that for some
important cases the second measure is a particular case of the first one.
Statistical uncertainty for some popular market network structures is analyzed.
Results of numerical evaluation of statistical uncertainty for minimum spanning
tree, market graph, maximum cliques and maximum independent sets are given. The

nonequilibrium properties such as the transport coefficients, the thermodynamic
entropy production, or the affinities, and quantities characterizing the

manifestation of modern algebra in statistics can be seen in the field of
algebraic statistics, which brings tools from commutative algebra and algebraic
geometry to bear on statistical problems. Now over two decades old, algebraic
statistics has applications in a wide range of theoretical and applied
statistical domains. Nevertheless, algebraic statistical methods are still not
mainstream, mostly due to a lack of easy off-the-shelf implementations. In this

persistent back-end socket connection running locally or on a cloud server.
Topics range from basic use of m2r to applications and design philosophy.
